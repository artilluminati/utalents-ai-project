I still think about the night
your mother and I had to leave you.
Hopefully, it's not for long,
but I'll call you when we get settled.
When I have a better indication of what's going on.
Mommy?
Jellybean.
Daddy and I have a last-minute business trip...
so Rose is gonna stay with you for a few days.
No. I don't want you to go.
Ugh. It's gonna be so boring.
I won't be able to keep my...
eyes...
Goodbye, sweetheart. All right, we'll see you soon.
Okay.
Janet, we gotta go.
I wish we could have put down our bags...
tucked you back into your bed...
but too many lives were at stake.
Oh, my God.
They've already launched.
We have to stop it.
Come on.
To disarm the missile, we had to get inside it...
but the plating was too thick.
The only way in was to shrink between the molecules.
I can't get through.
Hank.
We both knew that if you go that small...
there is no coming back.
It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged.
Your mother's wasn't.
Tell Hope I love her.
She turned it off.
Janet. No!
She went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.
Your mother saved thousands of lives that day
knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm.
Alone.
Afraid.
Gone forever.
Telling you that she wasn't coming home...
was the hardest thing that I ever had to do.
But then Scott showed up.
Or should I say, broke into our house.
And when he went to the quantum realm...
and came back.
Everything changed.
I started to wonder...
could your mother still be alive?
So, I dusted off some old plans.
Dad, what are you saying?
I think it's possible to bring her back.
Okay. We're in.
Oh, this place is a maze.
Where's that map?
We're definitely close.
- You ready? - I'm ready, Daddy.
Are you sure? 'Cause once we're inside,
you show any hesitation or fear, we're done.
I eat fear for breakfast.
Wow. That is super cool.
Come on.
Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way.
Anton, which way do we go?
Anton, which way do we go?
Thanks, Anton!
Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility.
Oh no, lasers!
Oh! I think I got lased!
The secret vault.
Tell me you brought the contact lens.
Yup.
Perfect! Right there.
There! It's the micro-treasure!
My trophy?
It looks like treasure.
Oh, it is to me.
I want to take it to show-and-tell.
Oh, no, you can't do that.
You can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important.
This is the best birthday present you ever got me.
I'm so touched you think
I'm the world's greatest grandma.
It was the only one they had.
It makes me want to knit you a sweater.
Oh, no, the fuzz!
Hey, Scotty...
I was looking at the schematics
for the Karapetyan buildings...
and I think we have
way too many security cameras, don't we?
No, no, not at all.
I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras.
I know what he needs.
Who's the security expert in our business?
You are, but I'm running the company, right?
And if we overquote him...
he's gonna go somewhere else.
I mean, we gotta land this bird.
He ain't goin' anywhere.
And the expression is "land this fish."
No, it's "land the bird."
Just like you land the plane.
You gotta land the plane to be in business.
I know it's silly to get hung up
on these kinds of things, but I do.
How am I gonna land a fish?
It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore...
and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?
You've really turned me around on this thing.
It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan.
Now, if you just excuse me...
I'm in the middle of trying to
steal something with my daughter.
I'm gonna go recheck it.
To the escape ant!
Let's bounce before the po-po come back!
The po-po? How do you even know that?
Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly!
Crash landing!
Whoo!
I wish we could shrink for real.
Oh. That is pretty cool.
Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty.
And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know.
But I feel like I'm way better.
My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff.
And my hands are shaking.
But I think it's unrelated, you know?
It's gonna be great, Luis!
You got nothing to worry about!
Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss.
I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Daddy!
Come on, Woo! I've got three days left.
Why would I try to escape?
Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules.
You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place.
Keel to stern, soup to nuts.
Thank you.
It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.
Our flying ant crashed.
Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old
when you can't leave the house.
You know the lengths that I've gone to?
Close-up magic.
I learned that.
Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?
Oh, Cassie.
This must all seem like a bunch of confusing
grown-up stuff to you, huh?
Well, think of it this way.
Your school has rules, right?
Like, you can't draw on the walls.
Well, your daddy went to Germany
and drew on the walls with Captain America.
And that was a violation of Article 16,
Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords.
Now, as a part of his joint plea deal...
with Homeland Security and the German government...
he was allowed to return to the U.S...
provided he serve two years under house arrest...
followed by three years of probation.
And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology...
or contact with any former associates who were...
or currently are in violation of said Accords.
Or any related statutes.
Okay, sweetie?
Wow. You're really great with kids.
Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor.
Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot...
but you haven't had any contact
with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?
- No. - You sure?
Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em.
It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too.
And associating with them breaks your deal.
And, uh, I don't need to remind you...
that any violation of your agreement
means 20 years in prison. Minimum.
I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.
They hate his guts.
Thanks, peanut.
How'd you do it, Scott?
Do what?
The card trick.
Seriously?
Oh, my God!
You people can't just show up here
whenever you want and search the place.
Actually, they can.
You need a warrant.
Actually, they don't.
Really? Wow.
Did you pack your soccer shoes?
- Yeah. - All right.
Next time I see you will be on the outside.
All right.
Oh, get on the inside of this.
Hey, three days. Seriously...
- I'm proud of you, bud. - Thank you.
You know what? Give me another one.
Me too! Gosh! Freedom!
New business! I am sensing greatness.
I had a fun weekend, Daddy.
Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend.
Once I'm outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red.
We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking.
You're gettin' good at that.
How'd you do that?
- Bye, Daddy. - Bye.
- Bye. - Bye.
Three days.
Easy-peasy.
Snap your fingers. That gets them to look over there.
And that is misdirection.
вЄ We had a dream
вЄ We'd go travelin' together
вЄ We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on вЄ
Easy-peasy.
Where are you?
Everything that you know...
Lost...
in the quantum realm.
What?
I'm gonna find you, Jellybean.
I found you!
You always find me, Mommy.
What the hell?
Hey, Hank! It's been a while.
Um, I don't even know if this is your number anymore.
And I'm probably the last person
you wanna hear from.
But I just had a really weird dream.
And I know that doesn't
sound like an emergency or anything...
but it just felt very real.
I was back in the quantum realm...
and I think I saw your wife.
And then I was your wife.
I mean, not in a weird way or anything.
You know, hearing this out loud,
I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency.
I'm sorry to bother you.
I'm sorry for a lot of things.
That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be...
Could be one, little, tiny universe.
Hope?
Is this another dream?
Do you think it was a dream...
or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?
I'm not sure.
I can't be here!
I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!
They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott.
You have to take me home. They could show up any second!
Relax. As far as your nanny cops know,
you're still at home.
Whoa!
Scotty?
He's programmed to replicate your daily routine.
Nine hours in bed.
Five hours in front of the TV.
Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about.
That's totally inaccurate.
And how do you know about my daily routine?
Are you spying on me?
We keep tabs on all security threats, all right?
And so far the biggest one we've had is you.
I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up.
They said it was a matter of national security.
That Cap needed help, so...
Cap?
Tain America. Captain. Cap.
It's what we call him.
If you're a friend.
I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little, I know him.
He's nice. Whatever.
I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught.
You didn't think about a lot of things.
How's Hank?
We're still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom.
How do you think he is?
I'm sorry. I know you're mad.
I'm not looking for an apology, Scott.
The only reason why we're even talking is...
because we need what's in your head.
Is this where you're living?
If you need help or money or something, maybe I can...
We're fine.
Hey, Hank. Look, I just wanna...
Save it!
- Can we start? - Yeah.
So, while you were relaxing at home...
we were building this.
It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm.
To my mom.
We think she might still be down there.
We just don't know where.
What?
If we can pinpoint my mom's location...
then the pod can take me down to get her.
You built all this and you don't even know
if she's alive?
It's called a hypothesis.
Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time.
It was overloaded and it shut down.
But for a split second,
the doorway to the quantum realm was opened.
And?
And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom.
We think when you were down there,
you may have entangled with her.
Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much.
Quantum entanglement, Scott.
We think she might have put
some kind of a message in your head.
Hopefully, a location.
And opening the tunnel triggered it.
Your mom put a message in my head?
Come on. That's insane.
No, Scott.
Insane is going to Germany
without telling us, and fighting the Avengers.
Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took.
Tell me you really destroyed it.
I did, I destroyed it, I swear.
I can't believe you destroyed my suit!
That was my life's work!
What was I supposed to do?
You were supposed to not take my suit!
I'm sorry, Hank!
I'm sorry I took the suit.
I'm sorry that I called last night.
I don't remember seeing Janet down there.
I wish that I did.
I just had a dream about her
playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.
What?
I had a dream.
She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl.
Cassie and I do it all the time.
Doesn't mean anything.
But was it Cassie in the dream?
No.
Where was she hiding?
- What? - The little girl.
Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?
No, it was in a tall dresser.
You mean a wardrobe.
Is that what that's called?
What color was it?
Red.
Were there horses on it?
Oh, boy.
It's where I hid every time that we played.
It doesn't sound like
you really got the gist of the game.
She's alive.
I knew it.
I knew it!
We need to get that part.
Okay.
The sooner we get the tunnel working...
the sooner we can get this message out of his head.
Does Burch have it?
- Yeah. Let's go. - What part?
Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?
We need a component to stop the tunnel
from overloading again.
I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.
Look, I'd really like to help you...
but if I'm not at home when they come
to take off my ankle monitor...
then I'm going away forever.
Once we get the component and power up the tunnel...
we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch.
We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last.
You owe us.
All right, fine. But can I just wait inside?
Because I'm not supposed to be out here.
Let's go.
- We good? - Yeah.
I'll be right back.
- Can I have one of these? - No.
Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!
Sonny!
Oui is French for "yes."
As in "yes" to farm-to-table, "yes" to locally sourced...
and "yes" to planet before profit.
Well, let's hope it also means "yes"
to "Do you have the component I ordered?"
You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan.
Have a seat.
No, I'm good. Thank you.
Who is this guy?
Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology.
He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.
Could I just have one...
No.
You know, I have a special friend at the FBI.
And I say "special"...
because, well, he tells me things
that I didn't previously know.
For example...
your name isn't Susan.
It's Hope Van Dyne.
And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym.
- That's not good, Hank. - No shit.
What do you want?
Relationships are built on trust, Hope.
And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation.
Our relationship?
My business landscape has been shifting, Hope.
Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore...
but now, Hank Pym...
Hank Pym is a real opportunity.
Do you have a point?
Oh, you think that I don't know
what you've been building with all this?
Quantum technology.
Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI,
forget cryptocurrency.
Quantum energy is the future.
It's the next gold rush.
Is that so?
I want in, Hope.
So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty...
of arranging some buyers for your lab.
Starting bid...
one billion dollars.
Thank you, Sonny, really.
But my father and I have something
slightly more pressing than starting a business.
So I'll just take the component as arranged.
My buyers don't take no for an answer.
So, we are either in business together...
or we aren't in business together.
Then I guess we aren't.
You can go.
But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain.
Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.
Listen, Sonny.
This is gonna be so much easier on everybody
if you just give me that component.
Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here...
is my heart, but it will mend in time.
Okay.
So, now what?
You'll see.
She said her and her daddy had something pressing.
- Mmm-hmm. - I want to know what it is
because if they're not working with us...
they're working with somebody. So find out.
I want some names...
Hold on, you gave her wings?
Get her.
Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier!
Stop firing! Stop!
All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go!
Go!
Wings and blasters.
So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.
No, I did.
It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny.
Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope.
I can assure you of that!
What in the hell is that?
Dad, are you seeing this?
Hope, get out of there!
- I gotta do something. - Wait!
It is still a work in progress.
You taught me that kick. Remember?
Yeah, great form.
Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?
Not the time, Scott.
Damn it, where'd it go?
I've lost it.
I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams.
Try looking...
Dad?
Give me that.
Now.
- Are you okay? - No!
He got the lab.
No.
Come on!
What was that?
I don't know.
But we need to find somewhere to regroup
and figure out where the lab is.
So, where to now?
How about my house? Hmm?
I'm supposed to be there anyway,
and Woo could walk in any second.
Exactly why we're not going to your house.
What about your house?
Sorry.
Well, there is one place I can think of.
No.
No, no, no, no!
No!
Wow, Dr. Pym...
who would've thought that,
once again, in your hour of need...
that you would turn to us, you know?
Not me.
Mmm. Help yourself.
Hey, what's up with the fancy pastry?
We gotta keep the food budget down.
Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?
The oatmeal packets.
Oatmeal packets.
- It's insult. - Why is it an insult?
Because it tastes like sand.
You know why? 'Cause it's organic.
It's not organic, it's sand.
It's the most important meal of the day.
You know what, you can get creative with it.
Break teeth.
Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon.
Put a little honey. Whatever you want...
Guys, guys, guys. Come on, man.
We got bigger fish to fry.
Is that my desk?
- Yeah. - What?
Why do I have such a small desk?
Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.
You snooze, you lose.
Well, I was under house arrest.
Yeah.
You know what, this isn't even a desk.
This is garbage.
You found this outside amongst garbage.
I got it at a rummage sale.
So, you save money on my desk?
Guys.
Hope, please, we need to focus, all right?
We gotta find that lab already. Jeez.
Oh, you know what? I heard stories,
like what happened to you.
This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff.
Like a ghost.
Like Baba Yaga.
Baba Yaga, the witch.
They tell stories to children to frighten them.
You know Baba Yaga?
Whoever stole it...
we need to find it.
Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you.
Like Baba Yaga.
Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know.
Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab?
Because if you didn't,
we have a variety of affordable options.
Of course I did, Luis. It was disabled.
Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing.
They also looked like they were phasing.
Phasing?
Quantum phasing. When an object moves
through different states of matter.
Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking.
The lab emits radiation.
Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?
That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab.
Where else can we find that equipment?
Well, there is one person.
Bill Foster.
Great!
Who's Bill Foster?
He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D.
They had a falling out years ago.
You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.
It's probably just a waste of time.
Hey, I'm risking everything by being here.
Don't you think we should check?
We need to find out who took the lab.
Guys, it's not a good idea
to be out in the open like this.
Relax, no one's gonna recognize us.
What, because of hats and sunglasses?
That's not a disguise, Hank.
We look like ourselves at a baseball game.
In an isolated system...
particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship.
If the system is interfered with,
that stability becomes chaos.
Unpredictable.
Dangerous. Beautiful.
Isolated completely, a quantum system
would revert back to separate states of matter...
each entangled with a distinct state of its environment.
In other words, the object in question
would be both in and out of phase...
with multiple parallel realities.
Speaking of being out of phase with reality.
I am noticing an unusually high number
of glazed eyes out there among you.
So, why don't we call it a few minutes early?
That'll be enough for today.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go.
It's incredible. You're linked to Janet.
It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of
Posner molecules in your brains.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Do you guys just put the word "quantum"
in front of everything?
Doctor, we need to find our lab.
Hope, I'd love to help you...
but I don't have anything
like the equipment you're describing.
I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go.
Don't condescend, Hank.
You're the one who's on the run from the FBI.
All because you had to grow to a size
that finally fit your ego.
That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot.
Really?
Going that big, it must've been exhausting.
I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.
Actually, I do.
Back in the day, I was Hank's partner
on a project called Goliath.
Excuse me? You were my partner?
The only thing more tiring than going that big
is putting up with Hank's bullshit.
Right...
I don't know. How big did you get?
My record? 21 feet.
- Not bad. - You?
I don't...
No, really, I'm curious.
- 65 feet. Yeah. - Whoa!
- Huge. - 65.
If you two are finished comparing sizes...
we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.
And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet?
Strange.
You had all the answers back in the day.
That's why I left the project.
Left? I fired you.
Best decision I ever made.
Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental...
stubborn, impatient.
Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away.
Just the mediocrities.
Janet was the only one who could endure him
and chose to stick it out.
Watch it, Bill.
She paid the price, though, didn't she?
You son of a bitch.
I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble.
I'm trying to save my mother.
Now, which office would you say?
Oh, it's Woo.
Someone must have seen me.
Relax. If this is about you,
they'd be in your house by now.
What are you, 15?
Come on. We gotta go right now.
Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker...
if you modify the diffraction units
on one of your regulators.
- That could work. - I don't know what that means.
Thank you. Thank you.
But, Doctor, campus police says
they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne.
I don't know what to tell you, Agent.
I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years.
I can assure you I'm the last person
he would want to visit.
Oh, come on, you expect us to...
Hey, hey.
Why is that?
Simple. We hate each other's guts.
So I'm a terrible partner?
Foster, he hasn't had one good idea
in his unremarkable career.
But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?
Fine, one decent idea.
Except, I eliminated the diffractors
when I upgraded the suits.
So, if we had an old suit,
we might be able to track down the lab?
Yes, but we don't.
- What if we did? - What do you mean?
I mean...
life's funny.
Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit.
What?
Well, it was your life's work, Hank.
I couldn't destroy that.
Before I turned myself in,
I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis.
You sent my suit through the mail?
Hey, the postal service is very reliable.
You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS.
Where is it?
It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry.
What, the trophy? No, it's not here.
What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?
I looked everywhere. It's not here.
Hey, get away from the plant.
But I put it back after Cassie and I...
Show-and-tell.
Scotty?
No, stop!
Well, the good news is I know where it is.
Whenever you go back to school...
isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller?
This place seems huge.
What is it?
It's the new regulator.
Hank, what's going on with this suit?
How much of a work in progress is this?
Uh-oh. No, no, no.
Oh.
What are you, laughing? Please, could you just...
Okay, okay.
What do you see?
The sizing coils are malfunctioning.
Just let me...
Ow!
- Sorry. - It's all right.
Okay. All right.
Try that.
Sorry.
What?
Awesome.
If only Cap could see you now.
Hilarious. What are we gonna do?
Hey!
Where's your hall pass?
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Hey!
Hey. Eh...
You can do it.
You almost got it.
Oh, peanut.
Okay, let's go.
Hiya, champ, how was school today?
All right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit?
So cranky.
You want a juice box and some string cheese?
Do you really have that?
Let's see if Foster was right.
This has gotta be the lab.
Let's go get it.
Yeah.
This seems right.
Look at us, teaming up twice in one day.
Makes you think, huh?
About what?
Germany.
What do you mean?
We were working together, training together...
and other stuffing together.
If I had asked you, would you have come?
I guess we'll never know.
But I do know one thing.
What?
If I had, you'd have never been caught.
Hey, Scott.
You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter
long enough to get my lab?
- Yes, sir. - Thank you.
Okay, you're transmitting.
What took you so long?
Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant.
I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant.
You like it?
Hilarious.
I'm not getting anything on the monitors.
There's some kind of electronic disturbance.
Be careful.
You know me, Hank. I'm always careful... Whoa!
It's okay. It's just the suit.
- How do you know? - Look.
That's Ghost?
What is she doing?
Do you think that suit is how
she goes through walls and stuff?
Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.
Hope, look! There's the lab.
Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building
and not somebody else's, right?
Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast.
I'll get it.
Oh, shit...
Hope. Hope! Hank.
Guys.
I don't think they can hear you.
Hi.
I'm Ava.
Scott.
So, you don't need the suit...
to go through things.
No.
It just helps me control it.
And the pain, supposedly.
You're not gonna reach into my chest
and crush my heart, are you?
You're funny.
I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to.
I need...
what's in your head.
Let's wake up the rest of the gang
and get this over with, shall we?
Get up!
Come on!
Dad?
Don't ever touch him again.
Now, now, Hope...
I think I'm being rather gentle with your father,
all things considered.
What the hell are you talking about?
Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego.
Bill.
What have you done?
It's what you've done, Dr. Pym.
You're with her?
Oh, man. I thought you were cool.
What the hell is going on here?
I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father.
Why would he?
Elihas Starr.
They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D.
Quantum research.
Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym.
You had him fired.
Oh, and discredited for good measure.
My father tried to continue his research on his own.
Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks.
No, no, no!
Too many.
Until something went wrong.
He told us to run.
Elihas, what's happening?
Just go. Go!
Daddy! Daddy!
I could tell he was scared.
Daddy!
Ava, no!
I didn't want him to be alone.
No! No!
When I woke up, my parents were dead.
I wasn't so lucky.
They call it "molecular disequilibrium."
A rather dull name, I think.
Doesn't quite do justice to what it means.
Every cell in my body is torn apart...
and stitched back together.
Over and over.
Every day.
I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call
about a quantum anomaly in Argentina.
Hello, Ava.
My name's Bill.
I was a friend of your father's.
I brought you something.
It's all right. Try again.
That's it.
Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe.
But others at S.H.I.E.L.D.
saw an opportunity in my affliction.
They built me a containment suit,
so I could control my phasing.
And trained me to be a stealth operative.
They weaponized me.
I stole for them. Spied for them.
Killed for them.
And in exchange for my soul...
they were going to cure me.
They lied.
When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in.
I built the chamber to slow her decay,
but her condition was progressive.
I didn't know how to cure it.
She wanted to kill you, Hank, but I told her no...
and that she should watch you instead.
And sure enough, she discovered
that you were building the tunnel.
Then, she told me about Lang.
And the message from Janet inside his head,
that's when I...
Christ's sake!
That's me. I'm sorry.
Look, can you tell me who's texting me?
"Cassie, 911."
That's my daughter. I need to text her back.
No, that's not happening.
What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency.
You're not making demands here, Lang.
You're not appreciating the gravity of the...
Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now.
Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please.
Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency?
I can't find my soccer shoes.
What?
I have a game tomorrow.
Hey, Scott, I know that they're there.
Can you just walk the phone around the house?
No, I can't do that right now.
- Why not? - Because I'm sick.
Hey, can you just maybe look around
later then and call me back?
Please? Thank you.
Bye, Daddy!
- Bye, peanut! - Feel better!
Feel better, buddy!
I'm sorry. It said emergency.
Ava, I want to help you.
She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her.
Oh, really? How?
Janet.
For the last 30 years, she's been down there
absorbing quantum energy.
We can extract that energy.
We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure...
Extract it?
- Yes. - Are you insane?
That would rip Janet apart.
You don't know that. I'm gonna fire up your tunnel.
When Janet's location
pops into Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me...
or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI.
What?
You are gonna stay here...
just in case I need your help.
Like hell I would help you!
You'll do whatever I say.
You're gonna kill Janet!
I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank.
Goddamn it, Bill!
- Dad? - Calm down, Hank.
So help me God...
The pills.
It's his heart! He needs his pills.
Please, Dr. Foster. They're in the tin. Please.
He could die!
Come on!
Help him!
Dad, just hang on, all right?
Just keep breathing. Stay calm.
Help him, man! Come on!
The Altoid tin!
Wait!
Thanks, guys.
Hank!
Bill is filling that girl's head with lies.
Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans.
Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in.
No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side.
Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch.
Good job.
It'll work.
Foster, he could have fried the entire system.
Look, we'll adjust the relays
while you go reprogram the settings, all right?
It's going to be fine.
So, this is it.
Yeah. You'd think with all this time
to prepare I'd be more ready.
Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for.
It kind of melts your mind.
I mean seeing my mom again.
Oh.
What if she's a completely different person?
Yeah, like, uh, George Washington.
I'm serious, Scott.
Or George Jefferson.
What if she's forgotten about me?
When I was in prison...
the only thing that got me through was Cassie.
I could have been locked up for 100 years...
I never would have forgotten her.
I know your mom is counting the minutes
until she can see you again.
Thank you.
Hey.
We got a big problem.
You forgot the motion sensor lights
on the back of the building.
Oh, no.
And they're on the proposal,
and Karapetyan asked for them specifically.
Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy.
Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it.
No. No, no, no, no.
The meeting is first thing in the morning.
You gotta come right now and fix it.
I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave.
You know what, I'm coming to you.
I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop.
And you can fix them there.
Just tell me where you are, okay?
It's complicated.
What do you mean it's complicated?
As you can see, sir,
this system is state of the art.
Security of tomorrow, today.
Oh, that's so good!
And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'.
Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's,
so we can fix the plans.
But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time.
- As you can see... - Oh, oh, oh!
Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning.
Down to the undercarriage, baby.
You sprung for the undercarriage wash?
Well, you said get the works.
That's a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota.
He's right.
The undercarriage wash,
that's for cleaning off road salt...
laid down in our more snow-laden sister states.
Who are you, and why do you know so much
about car wash protocol?
Well, my name is Sonny Burch.
And I do my research, Luis.
To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine...
at the FBI that you are
a known associate of Scott Lang...
a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned...
has a portable shrinking laboratory...
filled with all kinds of juicy tech.
And you're gonna tell me where it is.
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis.
And I have promised results to some dangerous people.
So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman.
Now...
Uzman is a master
at extracting information from the unwilling...
through psychoactive means.
Oh, is that truth serum?
There's no such thing as truth serum.
That's just nonsense from TV.
Well, what is it then?
It's a little concoction
that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S.
It makes you suggestible and highly responsive.
Well, dude, that's truth serum.
No, it's not.
No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me.
- Right? - It's not a truth serum.
Okay. Hey, I believe you.
It's not a truth serum.
I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks...
The truth serum.
Well, I have a lot of allergies...
so you might wanna think about that.
We've got to get that lab back.
What?
The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore.
How long have I got?
A couple of weeks, maybe.
Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back.
How?
Lang. He has a daughter, right?
You can't mean that.
Ava!
I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there...
but I won't be a part of anything like that.
You're not the one who's about
to fade away into nothing, Bill.
I am!
You said you could fix me!
You promised.
I know. I will.
But not like that.
You lay one finger on that little girl...
I won't help you. And we're done.
Fine.
There are other options.
You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum.
Because I don't feel anything.
That was a lie. I do feel something.
This is truth serum!
There's no such thing!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis.
Okay.
Where is Scott Lang?
Well, see, that's complicated.
Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place.
And I'm not talkin' about cell block D.
His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like...
"Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"
And he was, like, "Yeah, I know.
"I thought I was gonna be with her forever...
"but now I'm all alone."
And I was, like, "Damn, homie. You know what?
"You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner.
"But you know what? I'm Luis."
And he says, "You know what? I'm Scotty,
"and we're gonna be best friends."
Okay, hold on, hold on.
I like a good story as much as the next person...
but what in the hell does this have to do
with where Scott Lang is?
I'm getting there. I'm getting there.
You put a dime in him,
you gotta let the whole song play out.
He like human jukebox.
Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant!
Yeah, only played Morrissey.
And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like...
You know, Chicanos, we call him "Moz."
Then, ВЎadios!
What can I say? We relate to his
melancholy ballads, you know?
- Lang! - Right, right, right.
So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail,
and he starts working for Hank.
That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like...
"I want nothing to do with you.
"Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."
And then Scotty's, like,
"You know what, girl? My heart is all broken.
"And I'll probably never find love again,
"but damn if I want to kiss you!"
But then you fast forward
and they're all into each other, right?
And then Scotty's, like,
"You know what? I can't tell you this...
"but I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."
And then she said, "I can't believe you split like that!
"Smell you later, dummy."
So, Scotty goes on house arrest.
And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like...
"Damn! I thought Hope coulda been
"my new true partner, but I blew it!"
But fate brought 'em back together.
And then Hope's heart is all...
"I'm worried that I can't trust him...
"and he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"
And then my heart is all, like...
"That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red
"and we're days away from going out of business. Oh!"
"Out of business"?
"Days away"?
Damn truth serum!
I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God.
I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke!
And the Karapetyan's our last hope.
And if we don't show up, we're done!
That's terrible bossing!
Damn, bro!
- That's on me! That's on me! - Hey!
Enough.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Where is Scott Lang?
I've been trying to tell you,
he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking.
Emotionally speaking.
Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking!
Oh! The woods.
The woods?
Baba Yaga!
What do you mean, "the woods"?
The Muir Woods, the second fire road
off the Panoramic Highway!
For God's sake!
вЄ Baba Yaga, come at night
вЄ Little children, sleepy tight вЄ
Damn it!
If that freak gets Pym's tech...
I'm never gonna see it.
So, what do we do now?
It's easier to steal it from the Feds
than from the boogeyman.
Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion?
I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang.
But you gonna have to take 'em down now,
because they ain't gonna be there for long.
And when you do, you gonna get me that lab.
Understood.
Good news, gentlemen.
Feds are gonna do the hard work for us.
What are you lookin' at? Change my tires!
Right.
- Sir. - Can you knock?
Sorry, sir. Uh, but I just got a lead.
Ooh, I love leads.
System's in the green.
Priming the coils.
Full charge.
As soon as the tunnel's open...
let us know if you get anything
that could be a part of her message.
Yeah, yeah. I will.
Okay, then.
Here it goes.
We did it!
You got anything?
Nothin'.
Well, just give it a minute, because it could...
No.
No, no, no, no!
What's happening?
It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off.
We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right!
Then what else could it be?
I don't know!
- Scott, what are you doing? - Scott, get away from that!
Scott, you can't...
I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have.
I need to fix the algorithm.
Trust me, after 30 years down here...
I've thought about it a lot.
Janet?
Hi, honey.
Jellybean.
Mom?
It's not the reunion I'd imagined.
It's all so rushed.
You two have done such great work.
You just need a little...
nudge.
Janet, how is this possible?
It wasn't a message you put
in Scott's head. It was an antenna.
Clever girl.
I'm so proud of you.
Honey, tell us where you are.
Tell us how to find you.
No, the probability fields are too complex.
That's why I needed to talk to you.
You have to follow my voice.
Of course!
Like tracing a call back to its source!
I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies...
between point two and point nine.
I'd narrow it to four and six.
That's too tight. We could miss you.
Look at us squabbling again.
Fine. All right, between three and seven.
Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that.
Bullseye.
Source lock.
It's you.
We got it!
You have to meet me at these exact coordinates.
In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void.
It's very dangerous,
especially on the human mind, so be careful.
Time and space work very differently down here.
You have two hours.
After that, the probability fields will shift...
and it'll be another century
before they align like this again.
We'll find you.
I know you will, Jellybean.
Nope.
Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet.
Perfect.
How did we get up here?
All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights...
and it's gonna get really trippy...
but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent.
Scott, I'll be fine.
I'm just saying because I've been down there.
Yeah, so you've mentioned.
Um, sorry. I have to take this.
Hey, man, you coming?
No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is.
And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are.
- What? - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Uh, they gave me some truth serum.
And then all of a sudden
I started talkin' all honestly.
Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher.
I hate it, I hate it.
- Uh... - But you need to go home...
because the Feds are probably going there now!
And by the way...
who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there!
I feel like such a jerk.
You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now.
What?
Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI.
How?
- I told Luis where we are. - You what?
I told him to come here so I could help him
with the Karapetyan proposal.
Oh, my God!
Look, we need to land that account.
Otherwise, we lose the business!
Do you know hard it is for ex-cons
to find work these days?
Jesus, Scott!
90 seconds to close the aperture!
You have to depolarize the coils first!
I know!
I'm really sorry...
but the, um, FBI is coming to my place so...
I have to go.
Can I borrow the suit?
Gyroscopic stabilizers.
Powering on.
I'm just gonna borrow the suit.
I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be.
- Don't bother. - What?
We'll come and get the suit from you,
as soon as we've found my mom.
- Hope... - Scott, just go!
- Scott? - Daddy?
It's us, buddy!
We're here for Cassie's shoes!
He must be resting.
Honey, why don't you go upstairs
and look under your bed?
Daddy, you upstairs?
Daddy?
What the...
He really lives like a pig these days.
Daddy?
Spread out!
Again?
You people have no shame!
The monitor says that he's in the bathroom.
Yeah, I'm not buying it!
Cassie, let the man get by!
But Daddy's super sick!
I'll see about that!
He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick!
I'll take my chances, sweetie.
He barfed. Like, a lot.
Young lady, I'm a federal agent.
I've seen worse things than vomit.
Like, "a lot" a lot?
- Yes! - Forget it, move aside!
No!
Woo!
- What are you doing here? - Scott.
I'm sorry, I'm just really sick.
I told you.
Excuse me.
Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know?
Sorry.
I'll start the van.
You get the lab.
Freeze! You're surrounded!
Hank Pym...
Hope Van Dyne...
you're under arrest.
This is harassment!
Actually, it's not.
What does the FBI even stand for...
"Forever Bothering Individuals"?
- His monitor check out? - Of course it does.
Damn it!
Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey.
We got 'em sir. Pym and Van Dyne are in custody.
Seriously? Yes!
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.
They're your friends. That's insensitive.
I just really needed a win, you know?
Anyway, I'll be back later
for the official end of your sentence!
Sorry for misjudging you, pal!
You should feel great about yourself!
What is it?
We have a man down.
And Pym's lab is gone.
Hey.
Thanks for covering for me.
Sure.
So...
how long have you been Ant-Man again?
Not long.
It just sort of happened.
I'm sorry for lying to you...
and I'm sorry for risking everything.
Daddy, it's okay.
It's not.
I do some dumb things...
and the people that I love the most pay the price.
Mainly you.
Trying to help people isn't dumb.
I screw it up just about every time.
So, maybe you just need someone watching your back...
like a partner.
Well, she's made it clear
that's about the last thing she wants.
Who?
Hope.
Wait, who did you think?
Me.
You?
Don't laugh.
I'd be a great partner.
Aw, peanut.
Aw. You would be awesome. And if I let you...
I would be a terrible dad.
Fine.
Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart.
She reminds me of you.
You gonna go help her?
I think you should help her.
I wish I could...
but I don't know how I could help her without hurting you.
You can do it.
You can do anything.
You are the world's greatest grandma.
Agent Woo will see you in an hour.
An hour? We don't have an hour.
Oh, you got somewhere else to be?
Oh, now, that's my girl.
All right, what's our plan?
To shrink that wall.
It looks load-bearing.
The ceiling could collapse.
Then we run like hell.
Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor.
Roughly five times that in the building at large.
They're all heavily armed.
Not great odds.
You got any better ideas?
Nope.
And I'm not giving up on Mom.
She'd be so proud of you.
Okay.
One...
two...
Scott?
What're you two just standing around for?
We gotta go find that lab.
What about me?
Perfect.
Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time.
Okay, now what?
You're asking me?
Get in!
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon...
or are you two gonna keep staring at each other...
until they start shooting at us?
Yeah.
- Hey, Burch. - Yeah.
Yeah, they're out.
I'm on my way.
Her suit is missing, and so is the van.
How could this happen?
I mean, what the dickens?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
So, uh, how do we find the lab?
After we lost it the first time...
I put on a new tracker...
of sorts.
That'll work.
Is it ready or not?
We can begin the extraction process.
Listen, Ava.
This whole thing could be very dangerous.
Maybe we should...
Maybe we should what? Wait?
I've got days until I'm dead.
We're doing this, Bill. Now.
Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet.
We don't have much time before
Mom's location shifts, and we lose her.
Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then.
You know, my pep-pep always said,
"If you want to do something right, you make a list."
So, we should do that.
One, we have to break into that lab.
Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost.
Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost.
That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right?
Let's call it 2-A.
Fight Ghost. 2-A.
Oh, also, we have to make sure that the lab
is fully grown for you to come back.
Otherwise, we're screwed.
Scott!
You want me to start again? I'll start again...
I'm going to dive.
The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here...
together, protecting the tunnel.
Let me do this, Hope. Please.
Let me get her.
I think he's right.
"Whassup?"
You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial?
"Whassup?"
I had him follow us.
I thought we could use some help.
All right. I'm in position.
The ants are headed in.
Copy that.
Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty.
- Do you want Pez? - No.
Cassie gave me this for my birthday.
By the way, I love that suit!
Thanks, man.
I wish I had a suit.
I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know?
Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers.
What is it?
Don't know.
It's them!
They can't be far.
All right, Hank. Hank?
Dad, what's your status?
Foster's taken care of.
Suiting up now.
I just wanted to save Ava.
She's facing death or something far more terrible.
She's afraid.
I'll help you find a cure when I get back.
I promise.
Together, we'll figure something out.
Good luck, Hank.
Thanks, Bill.
Now, I'm gonna need you to step back.
Time remaining, 15 minutes.
Hank's in, Scott.
Any sign of her?
No, nothing yet.
Ava!
Call off the ants, Scott.
Oh, boy!
Can I get a status report?
'Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here!
Ready to dive.
- In case I don't make it... - Don't.
Don't say that.
I can't lose you, too.
I love you, Hope.
Guys, everything's bad over here.
Now.
Misdirection.
One of the first things they teach you
at Online Close-up Magic University.
No!
Plan worked. We got it, Scotty!
Meet us at the rendezvous point.
Okay, on my way!
Oh, no.
Really? This guy again?
Who?
I told you our business wasn't over.
Change of plans.
Hang on.
I want that lab, boys, whatever it takes.
Hold on.
That undercarriage is filthy!
Oh, they got bigger problems.
Hope, what're you doing?
You're heading away from the rendezvous point!
Don't worry,
I'm taking these guys on the scenic route.
Wait, what're you... Oh.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!
Signal lost.
What the hell are they doing up there?
Recalibrating.
Recalibrating.
You never said it was so beautiful, Scott.
Recalibrating.
Okay, any time now.
Recalibrating.
- Recalibrating. - Come on.
Signal restored.
Bikes, it's all you.
- Take the wheel. - What? Wait! Whoa.
Well, the 60's were fun, but now I'm paying for it.
Be careful up there!
Hey, give me a break! I haven't driven in two years!
Oh, you got pezed!
Up here!
Oh, that's not good.
Hope!
- No! - No!
There it is, right there. Get the lab!
Get the lab!
I've got her. Westbound on Fremont.
Hope! Wait!
Hey, what about me?
We got you now, Ava!
Whoa! Oh!
Not again!
Piece of junk!
Ah! Yes!
Go, go, go, go, go!
Burch got the lab.
I'm going after him.
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Work in progress, my ass...
Scott, where are you?
I've got Burch in my sights. Hurry!
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming!
We're running out of time.
Warning, approaching quantum void.
I'm coming to you, honey.
Guys.
Don't you need the remote to the lab? I just found it.
We can't grow the lab without it.
Get it to us fast.
Yeah, but the van is busted.
Use the Hot Wheels Rally case.
What?
I love you, Dr. Pym.
The remote! We're missing the remote!
You gotta check the van!
Huh?
Awesome!
Hey, I'm going down Pacific.
Burch's boys are all over me.
I'm on my way.
Right. I'll get the lab.
Hi.
Oh, that's badass!
Nice.
Doink!
Come here, you little weasel!
No, you don't!
I guess maybe you do.
Come on!
Anyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building?
How'd he even have time to buy a ticket?
Would you just one time,
please work!
Yes!
All right, I need help.
Yes!
Oh. Sorry. Ah...
Somebody!
Hey! Come on, man!
Not cool!
Murderers!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas!
You're a badass!
Yes!
No, no, no!
Ant-onio!
Our friends, the humpbacks,
dip in here to the San Francisco Bay...
for a little leisure and a little breeding.
Listen, Uzman...
And perhaps they're down below as we speak, doing the nasty.
Just meet me at the waterfront.
In three hours.
Oh, folks. We've barely left the dock...
but it looks like we got some company.
Look. Right there. Do you see it, folks?
There it is. There's a breach.
What the...?
Hi. Sorry. Hi.
It's okay. It's okay!
Sorry, I know I'm not a whale. This will just take a second.
Hey! That doesn't belong to you!
No, no! No, no!
You're embarrassing yourself now
Come on. Let go.
Thank you.
I'll take this now.
It melts your mind.
A message in your head.
I had a dream.
Daddy? Where's Mommy?
It's where I hid every time that we played.
I love you, Hank.
Daddy?
Daddy?
Dad? What's going on?
Why haven't you found Mom?
You look lost, Hank. Are you all right?
Still think you have all the answers, Hank?
It's me.
I'm so sorry...
it took so long.
No.
No.
You're here now.
Let's go home.
I thought I was gone.
But that energy from your hands...
how did you do that?
I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry.
This place...
it changes you.
Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is...
evolution.
Lab coordinates not found.
Do not ascend.
I should probably tell you
what we're dealing with up there.
I got the lab. I got the lab.
Move. Move.
Move!
Get out of the way.
Let's go.
No one here appears to be sure what this is.
It's gotta be 80-85 feet tall.
Get out of the way!
I got the lab.
The air feels chunky.
Oh, no. He's too big.
Scotty!
Scott!
I'm gonna go to sleep.
I'm just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes.
I just need five minutes.
Five minutes!
You get the lab somewhere safe.
- Scott's air won't last. - Okay.
Move!
Move! Move!
No, wait!
Lab at full scale.
They did it.
Ready to ascend.
Let's go see our daughter.
Scott!
Scott!
Scott, come on, wake up!
Come on. Come on, where are you, Scott?
Gotcha.
Scott?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, Scotty! Hope, come in.
Did you get crushed by the building?
Where's the remote, Luis?
It's probably in there.
I don't have it. I don't have it.
I guess this is where we say...
Adios, amigo.
No, no, no, no!
Thanks, guys.
Ava?
Ava!
Ava!
Almost ready for extraction.
Please, stop! People are getting hurt!
Everything hurts. Don't talk to me about pain!
What if Hank is right?
What if this process kills Janet?
What, you're worried about her?
All I'm saying is that she is a brilliant scientist.
She may be able to help.
Oh, she will help. Right now!
And if she dies, she dies!
No, no. I'm sorry, we can't do this.
We have to find another way.
This is the way.
Janet!
She started the extraction.
She's gonna tear Mom apart.
No!
Hope!
Are you okay?
Mom?
Oh, my God.
We found you.
I missed you so much.
I missed you too, Jellybean.
It's okay.
I'm here now. We have time.
No more last-minute business trips, okay?
I promise.
No, it's okay!
It's all right. Just don't worry about me.
- I'll be fine. - Dad.
Scott.
Miss Van Dyne.
It's nice to...
Well, I guess we've already met.
Yeah. I guess we have.
Wait.
Your pain.
I can feel it.
It hurts.
It always hurts.
I'm sorry.
I think I can help you.
Did you know she could do that?
It's okay.
Guys, the cops are coming!
Whoa.
The cops are coming. Like, all of 'em!
- I gotta go. - We gotta go!
What about them?
Hands in the air!
- No! We are going to our jobs. - No.
You see, we see these guys. They trying to shoot people.
So we apprehended them. For you. You're welcome.
We traffic in stolen technology.
And we have killed many, many people.
Uh, he's in charge.
That's true, I am.
I've also committed
numerous health code violations in my restaurant.
Some of them would shock you.
It is truth serum.
We gotta get outta here.
Fast.
I have an idea.
Giant figure, now spotted
at the intersection of Broadway and Laguna.
All units move in.
Go, go!
There he is!
It's over, Scotty!
I'm sorry, but we got you, man!
Come on. It's the end of the line, pal.
There's nowhere to hide.
Just pull off that Band-Aid! You lost! It's okay!
Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself!
Magic.
Damn it!
Get to Lang's, now!
Well done, honey.
Let's go!
Leave me here.
We can make it.
You said it yourself.
I've hurt people.
But you haven't.
Go. Please!
We can make it, Ava.
Bill...
I'm not leaving you.
Oh, hey, guys.
Are my two years up already?
What's it like out there?
Huh? I mean, do people still dance?
Are food trucks still a thing?
Well, you got away with it this time, Scott...
but, uh, I'll be seeing you again.
Where?
Huh?
Where will you be seeing me again?
Like, in general...
The next time you do something bad,
- I'll be there to catch you... - Oh.
You'll be watching...
I thought you were inviting me somewhere.
Why would I do that?
That's what I was wondering, why would you do that?
Like a party, or like, dinner or something?
I don't know. I thought you planned the evening.
I meant, "I'll arrest you later, again."
Of course, that would be strange.
- Take it easy, Jimmy. - Okay.
Did you want to grab dinner, or something?
I mean, because I'm free...
Yeah. Come on.
You ready?
Yeah!
- Hi. - Hi. Hi.
Oh!
Yes, that was us. How can I help you?
X-Con Security.
Mr. Karapetyan?
Yeah, you saw that?
It would be an honor to be in business with you as well.
I'll see you Thursday, 9:00 AM. Okay.
Yeah!
That's how you close a deal!
This is awesome.
So, Cassie...
what do you want to be when you grow up?
I wanna help people...
like my dad.
Really?
I wanted to be his partner.
But he said he wants you.
Is that so?
Daddy!
Whoa! Hold on.
Move, get outta here!
Scott, don't, don't, don't!
Ow.
Oh, gross!
Ugh. I hate that moth dust!
Go! Shoo! Shoo!
I used to be a respected scientist.
I had my name on the sides of buildings.
Now, I got this.
Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel.
This is... smaller.
Oh. Sorry. My bad.
Ah, I think it has flair.
All right. Control's online.
The collection unit activates when you decouple it.
It should automatically start absorbing
quantum healing particles.
Also, make sure you stay out of the tardigrade fields.
They're cute, but they'll eat you.
And don't get sucked into a time vortex.
We won't be able to save you.
Okay.
Going subatomic in five...
four...
three...
two...
one.
All right, Scott, this is a mic check.
Mic check, one, two. One, two.
How's everybody doing tonight in the quantum realm?
Scott, we read you.
I just wanna make sure.
Okay.
Healing particles secured for our new Ghost friend.
Great.
Preparing for re-entry in...
five, four, three...
Hello?
Ha, ha. Very funny.
Hank, quit screwing around.
You told me yourself not to screw around.
Hank?
Hope?
Janet.
Guys.
Guys.
Okay, seriously, don't joke around.
Bring me up, let's go.
Guys!

Stark!
He doesn't seem happy.
Hello, Hank.
You're supposed to be in Moscow.
I took a detour...
Through your defense lab.
Tell me that isn't what I think it is.
That depends if you think it's a poor attempt to replicate my work.
Even for this group, that takes nerve.
You were instructed to go to Russia.
May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you're a soldier...
I'm a scientist.
Then act like one.
The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed.
Help us put it to good use.
I let you turn me into your errand boy,
and now you try to steal my research?
If only you'd protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.
Ah...
Easy, Hank.
You mention my wife again
and I'll show you ferocity.
Don't look at me. You said it.
I formally tender my resignation.
We don't accept it. Formally.
Hank,
we need you.
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.
Don't let your past determine the future.
As long as I am alive,
nobody will ever get that formula.
We shouldn't let him leave the building.
You've already lied to him. Now you want to go to war with him?
Yes.
Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.
He just kicked your ass, full-size.
You really want to find out what it's like when you can't see him coming?
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.
He's no security risk.
Unless we make him one.
You like that?
You like that?
Come get you some now.
You didn't even move.
Nah.
What if I come in on the left side, right? Just down here.
You see this right here?
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.
Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals.
All right, break it up.
Break it up! Break it up!
Scotty!
What's up, man!
Damn! Hey.
Ha-ha! Hey, man.
Hey, what's up with your eye?
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy. It's a going-away present.
Oh, yeah. I still got my scar from a year ago.
- Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
You know what? I'm still the only one who knocked him out.
Well, I definitely didn't.
Thanks for picking me up, brother.
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss my celly getting out?
Hey, how's your girl, man?
Oh, she left me.
- Oh. - Yeah, my ma died, too.
And my dad got deported.
But I got the van!
- It's nice. - Yeah, right?
Thanks for the hook-up, too. I needed a place to stay.
You wait till you see this couch. You're gonna be really happy.
You're gonna be on your feet in no time. Watch.
- I hope so. - Yeah.
And I gotta introduce you to some people. Some really skilled people.
- Not interested. - Yeah, right.
No, I'm serious, man. I'm not going back.
I got a daughter to take care of.
You know that jobs don't come easy for ex-cons, right?
Look, man, I got a master's in electrical engineering, all right?
I'm gonna be fine.
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.
Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?
Uh, no, thanks.
Um, I will have... I'll have a burger, please.
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard... Do you have mustard dip?
It's ice cream. Baskin-Robbins.
I'll just do, like, whatever's hot and fresh.
Dude.
Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.
Sure thing, Dale.
Darby, could you just, uh, take care of this idiot? Thanks.
- Hey, Dale. - Come on in.
Pull up some chair.
Three years at San Quentin, huh?
You found out.
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.
Look, I'm sorry, all right? But I...
No one would hire me.
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.
Look, I'm sorry.
I don't do it anymore. I just...
Respect.
I couldn't be happier about it.
- Really? - Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you.
You really stuck it to those billionaire SOBs.
The more I read about what you did and stuff...
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?
"I'm in charge of this guy?"
Well, I'm very happy in this job,
and I really just appreciate the opportunity to...
Well, you're fired, of course.
I can't really keep you on.
Wait, what? Fired?
Yeah.
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime. I mean, I'm a good worker.
No, it wasn't a violent crime. It was a cool crime.
I'll tell you what, though.
This will be totally off the books, off the records,
but if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts
on your way out the door,
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.
Hey, Scotty. What's up?
I thought you were supposed to be at work.
I was. I got fired.
Damn. They find out who you are?
Yeah.
Baskin-Robbins always finds out, bro.
Baskin-Robbins don't play.
- You want some waffles? - Yeah, I'll take a waffle.
Oh. That's Kurt.
He was Folsom for five years. He's a wizard on that laptop.
- Nice meet you. - Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.
Who are you?
Dave.
Nice work on the Vista job.
Vista job, yes.
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.
Well, technically, I didn't rob them. Robbery involves threat.
I hate violence. I burgled them. I'm a cat burglar.
You mean you're a pussy.
Yeah.
They were overcharging the customers, right?
And it added up to millions.
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.
And what does he do?
He hacks into the security system
and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.
Posts all the bank records online.
And he drove the dude's Bentley into his swimming pool.
What are you doing?
Hmm?
Why are you telling my life story to these guys?
What do you want?
Okay.
My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago
- about this little perfect job. - No way.
No, no, no. Wait! This guy... This guy fits your M.O.
No!
I'm finished, man. I'm not going back to jail.
It's some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute.
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!
I don't care. I'm out.
Dr. Pym?
Yes. I'm still alive.
ID?
Perhaps that will suffice.
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.
Is that Hank Pym?
Good morning, Hank.
Hope.
Would it kill you to call me Dad?
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that you could find the time to join us today.
More like "thrilled."
I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren.
What's the occasion?
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?
We're ready for you inside.
Ouch.
I guess some old wounds never heal, huh?
Don't worry, she's in good hands.
You're in for a treat.
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym. How's retirement?
How's your face?
After you.
Now, before we start, I'd like to introduce a very special guest.
This company's founder and my mentor,
Dr. Hank Pym.
When I took over this company for Dr. Pym,
I immediately started researching a particle
that could change the distance between atoms,
while increasing density and strength.
Why this revolutionary idea remained buried
beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.
But just imagine,
a soldier the size of an insect.
The ultimate secret weapon.
An Ant-Man.
That's what they called you. Right, Hank?
Silly, I know.
Propaganda.
Tales to astonish!
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.
Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me
every single time I asked you,
"Was the Ant-Man real?"
Just a tall tale.
Right.
Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real?
Well, I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man.
And with my breakthrough shrinking inorganic material,
I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person?
Could that be done?
Well, it's not a legend anymore.
Distinguished guests,
I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it.
The Yellowjacket!
Oh, no.
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war
capable of altering the size of the wearer
for the ultimate combat advantage.
We live in an era
in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves
are undermined by constant surveillance.
It's time to return to a simpler age.
One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly
to protect their interests.
An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,
The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict
on the geopolitical landscape
completely unseen.
Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault.
Practical applications include surveillance,
industrial sabotage,
and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace.
A single Yellowjacket
offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions.
And, one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets
will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world.
The Yellowjacket.
So, it's a suit?
Don't be crude, Frank.
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.
What's the matter? You're not impressed?
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.
Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.
We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank.
I really value your opinion.
Thank you for coming. Hope?
Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now.
Thank you.
You seem a bit shocked.
Darren, there's a reason that I buried these secrets.
So you finally admit it!
We could have done this together, Hank. But you ruined that.
That's why you're the past and I'm the future.
Don't do this.
Dr. Cross?
You sell to me first, 20% over your asking price,
I can have the cash here in two weeks.
Deal.
We have to make our move, Hank.
How close is he?
He still can't shrink a live subject.
Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.
No.
I have Cross' complete trust.
- It's too dangerous. - We don't have a choice.
Well, that's not entirely true.
I think I found a guy.
Who?
Daddy!
Peanut! Oh!
Happy birthday!
I'm so sorry I'm late.
I didn't know what time your party started.
It was on the invitation.
He didn't get an invitation.
But he came anyway!
Well, I'm not gonna miss my little girl's birthday party.
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.
Oh, you don't...
What are you doing here, Lang?
You haven't paid a dime of child support.
You know, right now, if I wanted to, I could arrest you.
It's good to see you too, Paxton.
Mommy's so happy you're here, she choked on her drink.
Hey, look what I have for you.
Can I open it now?
Of course, sweetheart. It's your birthday.
You're my bestest friend.
What is that thing?
He's so ugly!
I love him!
Can I go show my friends?
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.
You're my bestest friend.
Look, the child support is coming, all right?
It's just hard finding a job when you have a record.
I'm sure you'll figure it out. But for now, I want you out of my house.
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday. - It's my house!
- So what? It's my kid! - Scott!
You can't just show up here. You know that. Come on.
It's a birthday party.
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.
She's my daughter.
You don't know the first thing about being a father.
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life.
Your fiancé is an asshat.
He's not an asshat.
- Hey, watch your language. Okay? - What language? I said "hat."
Stop it.
Really, Maggie? That guy?
Come on! You could marry anyone you want,
and you have to get engaged to a cop?
At least he's not a crook.
I'm trying, okay? I've changed. I'm straight.
I had a job and...
I wanna provide.
I had a lot of time to think about it and I love her.
So much.
I've missed so much time and I wanna be a part of her life.
What do I do?
Get an apartment,
get a job, pay child support.
And then we will talk about visitation, I promise.
You're her hero, Scott.
Just be the person that she already thinks you are.
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.
Yeah. Well, uh...
Unfortunately, we can't just do whatever we want.
It'd be nice though, right?
But there are laws.
What laws? Of man?
The laws of nature transcend the laws of man.
And I've transcended the laws of nature.
Darren, I don't think you understand...
Hmm.
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.
Goodbye, Frank.
Thank you.
You know, I've been thinking a lot about gratitude lately.
And today, during my morning meditation,
an interesting thought occurred to me, and I think it might apply to you, too.
How's that?
Gratitude can be forgiveness.
I've spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym.
I devoted my genius to him.
I could have worked anywhere.
I chose my mentor poorly.
You didn't even have a choice.
He never believed in you.
It's a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn't he?
But we shouldn't be angry, we should be grateful.
Because his failures as a mentor,
as a father,
forced us to spread our wings.
You're a success, Darren.
You deserve everything coming your way.
Ooh.
Stop cheating.
Hey, what's up, hotshot?
Maybe he didn't hear you.
How was the party?
- Tell me about that tip. - What?
I wanna know about that tip.
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.
Calm down, all right? I just need to know where it came from.
It's gotta be airtight.
Okay.
I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto.
Which was mainly reds, and you know I don't like reds, man.
But there was a rosé that saved the day. It was delightful.
And then he tells me about this girl, Emily, that we used to kick it with.
It was actually the first pair of boobs I ever touched.
It's the wrong details.
It has nothing to do with the story.
Go.
So, uh, he tells me that she's working as a housekeeper now, right?
And she's dating this dude, Carlos, who's a shot caller from across the bay.
And she tells him about the dude that she's cleaning for.
Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO
That is all retired now, but he's loaded.
And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team,
and they get to talking, right?
And here comes the good part. Carlos says, "Yo, man.
"This guy's got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chilling."
Of course Ernesto comes to me because he knows I got mad thieving skills.
Of course, I ask him...
"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was?"
And he says, "Nah, dawg.
"All she said is that it's super-legit
"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."
What?
Old man have safe.
And he's gone for a week.
All right. There's an old man, he's got a safe,
and he's gone for a week.
Let's just work with that.
You know what I'm saying?
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.
No one will be making for distress call tonight.
Comm check.
- Check. - Check.
Hey, if the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?
Don't worry.
It's not gonna happen.
I love it when he gets cocky.
Damn!
Alarm is dead.
Nice.
All right, I'm moving through the house.
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.
It's got what? Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.
Aw, man, are we screwed?
Not necessarily.
I'm in.
No alarms have been triggered. He's in like the Flynn.
Oh, man.
What is it?
Well, they weren't kidding. This safe is serious.
How serious are we talking, Scotty?
It's a Carbondale.
It's from 1910.
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.
Wow.
Can you crack it?
Well, here's the thing. It doesn't do so well in the cold.
Remember what that iceberg did?
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.
Killed everybody.
Did not kill the Old lady.
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.
What are you doing?
I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen.
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.
- What are you doing now? - Waiting.
Waiting.
Nice.
What is it? Cash? Jewels?
- There's nothing here. - What did you say?
- It's a suit. - What?
It's an old motorcycle suit.
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?
No.
It's a bust.
I'm really sorry, Scotty.
I know you needed to score.
I thought we were using mice.
What's the difference?
Commence Experiment 34-C. Organic atomic reduction.
Darren, maybe we should think...
Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology.
I can't go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.
Experiment 34-C results,
negative.
Sanitize the work station. Bring in subject 35-C.
Why would you lock this up?
This is so weird.
Scotty, what's up, man?
I wonder... What is this?
The world sure seems different from down here, doesn't it, Scott?
What? Who said that?
Luis, down here!
It's a trial by fire, Scott. Or, in this case,
water.
Guess you're tougher than you thought.
Oh, I don't want to see this!
Luis!
Son of a...
What the hell?
Not bad for a test drive.
Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.
No! No! No, thank you!
Get down on the ground!
You are under arrest!
No, I didn't steal anything! I was returning something I stole.
Oh...
Don't move.
You know, you almost had us convinced
that you were gonna change your ways.
They were really rooting for you.
It's gonna break their hearts.
- You got a visitor. - Who?
Your lawyer.
My lawyer?
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.
I'm starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.
Oh, man.
Sit down.
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.
I don't even wanna know why you have it.
Maggie was right about you.
How do you know about...
No wonder she's trying to keep you away from Cassie.
The moment things get hard,
you turn right back to crime.
The way I see it, you have a choice.
You can either spend the rest of your life in prison,
or go back to your cell
and await further instructions.
I don't understand.
No, I don't expect you to.
But you don't have many options right now, and quite frankly,
neither do I.
Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?
What?
Second chances don't come around all that much.
So, next time you think you might see one,
I suggest you take a real close look at it.
You're my bestest friend!
Are you sure you don't want a different toy?
No, I love this one.
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.
- Mommy? - Hmm?
Is Daddy a bad man?
I heard some grownups say he's bad.
No.
Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?
Smart choice. You actually listened, for once.
Under the door.
Okay, where to now?
- Hang tight. - Oh, God.
What, what?
Where the hell did he go?
I have no idea. He just vanished.
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!
Get back! Get back!
Scott, these are my associates.
Is that a camera on an ant?
Yeah, sure. Why not?
Where's the car?
No car. We've got wings.
Incoming!
Put your foot on the central node and mount the thorax.
- How safe is... - Just get on the damn ant, Scott!
Why am I on a police car? Shouldn't I not be on a police car?
So they can give you a lift past their five-block perimeter.
All right.
- Now, what's the next move? - Hang on tight.
Oh, this is easy! I'm getting the hang of this.
Yank up to go up. It's like a horse.
You're throwing 247 off balance.
Wait, his name is 247?
He doesn't have a name, he has a number, Scott.
Do you have any idea how many ants there are?
Whoa!
Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!
- No, I think it's 247. - Wait.
Hang on tight!
I think I'm getting the hang of this.
I am controlling 247. He is not listening to you.
What?
- Can I make one little request? - No.
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.
Time out.
All right, hold on.
Just wait! Whoa!
What happens if I throw up in this helmet?
It's my helmet, Scott. You do not throw up.
Let's set her down, all right?
I'm getting light-headed.
Hang on, Scott.
I'm getting a little light...
I need a snooze button.
Hit me in 5 minutes.
Hello.
Who are you?
Have you been standing there, watching me sleep, this whole time?
Yes.
Why?
Because the last time you were here, you stole something.
Oh. Oh.
Hey, look...
Whoa!
Paraponera clavata.
Giant tropical bullet ants,
ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index.
They're here to keep an eye on you when I can't.
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.
Who?
Hey!
Um... Whose pajamas are these?
How am I supposed to do this?
All right, just one step at a time.
Ugh!
You don't bite me, I don't step on you. Deal?
I could take down the servers and Cross wouldn't even know it.
We don't need this guy.
I assume that you've already met my daughter, Hope.
I did. She's great.
She doesn't think that we need you.
We don't. We can do this ourselves.
I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit,
and then Hope has you arrested.
Okay, we can try this and when he fails, I'll do it myself.
She's a little bit anxious.
It has to do with this job,
which, judging by the fact that you're sitting opposite me,
I take it that you're interested in.
What job?
Would you like some tea?
Uh... Sure.
I was very impressed with
how you managed to get past my security system.
Freezing that metal was particularly clever.
Were you watching me?
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.
Oh! Excuse me.
"Burgled" Vista Corp.
Vista's security system was one of the most advanced in the business.
It was supposed to be unbeatable.
But you beat it.
Would you like some sugar?
Yeah, thanks.
You know what? I'm okay.
How do you make them do that?
Ants can lift objects 50 times their weight.
They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.
Right. But how do you make them do that?
I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.
I speak to them.
I can go anywhere, hear anything,
and see everything.
And still know absolutely nothing.
I'm late to meet Cross.
Uh... Dr. Pym?
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.
Sorry, I just have one question.
Who are you, who is she, what the hell's going on,
and can I go back to jail now?
Come with me.
40 years ago, I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.
Huh?
I learned how to change the distance between atoms.
That's what powers the suit.
That's why it works.
Wow.
- Whoa! - But it was dangerous.
It was too dangerous.
So I hid it from the world.
And that's when I switched gears and I started my own company.
Pym Tech.
Yes.
I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.
Darren Cross.
He's a big deal.
But before he was a big deal, he was my assistant.
I thought I saw something in him. The son I never had, perhaps.
He was brilliant, but as we became close,
he began to suspect that I wasn't telling him everything.
He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particle,
and he became obsessed with recreating my formula.
But I wouldn't help him.
So he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.
How could he do that?
The board's chairman is my daughter, Hope.
She was the deciding vote.
But she came back to me
when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula.
The process is highly volatile.
If one isn't protected by a specialized helmet,
it can affect the brain's chemistry.
I don't think Darren realizes this,
and, you know, he's not the most stable guy to begin with.
So, what do you want from me?
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption.
Do you?
I do.
If you can help me,
I promise I can help you be with your daughter again.
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?
Absolutely.
My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done.
What do you want me to do?
I want you to break into a place and steal some shit.
Are you gonna be home for dinner tonight?
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up. Text me.
Okay. Good news?
Uh... I don't know. It's news.
Are you trying to find my daddy?
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.
I just want your daddy to be safe.
Hope you don't catch him.
This isn't the first time these guys
have tried to get their hands on game-changing weaponry.
That's Mitchell Carson, Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.
Presently in the business of toppling governments.
He always wanted my tech.
And now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket
and destroy all the data,
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.
I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.
I spent half my life
trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark.
I'm sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now.
This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit.
This could change the texture of reality.
Besides, they're probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.
Okay, then why don't you just send the ants?
Scott, they are ants.
Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader.
Somebody that could infiltrate a place that's designed to prevent infiltration.
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean, I'm a good thief, but this is insane.
He's right, Hank. And you know it.
You've seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of.
I was against using him when we had months,
and now we have days.
I'm wearing the suit.
Absolutely not!
I know the facility inside and out. I know how Cross thinks.
I know this mission better than anybody here.
We need you close to Cross. Otherwise, this mission cannot work.
- We don't have time to screw around! - Hope, please listen to me...
He is a criminal! I'm your daughter.
No!
She's right, Hank.
I'm not your guy.
Why don't you wear the suit?
You think I don't want to?
I can't.
I spent years wearing it,
and it took a toll on me.
You're our only option.
Before Hope lost her mother,
she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world.
And now she looks at me and there's just disappointment.
It's too late for me,
but not for you.
This is your chance.
The chance to earn that look in your daughter's eyes.
To become the hero that she already thinks you are.
It's not about saving our world.
It's about saving theirs.
Damn. That was a good speech.
Scott,
I need you to be the Ant-Man.
In the right hands,
the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic.
The suit has power. The man harnesses that power.
You need to be skillful, agile, and above all,
you need to be fast.
You should be able to shrink and grow
on a dime.
So your size always suits your needs.
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.
You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big.
Ow!
Ahhh!
Ow!
Useless.
When you're small, energy's compressed,
so you have the force of a 200-pound man
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide. You're like a bullet.
You punch too hard, you kill someone. Too soft, it's a love tap.
In other words, you have to know how to punch.
I was in prison for three years. I know how to punch.
Show me.
- Terrible. - You wanna show me how to punch?
Show me...
That's how you punch.
- She's been looking forward to this. - No kidding.
Hope trained in martial arts at a difficult time.
Oh, by "difficult time," he means when my mother died.
We lost her in a plane crash.
It's bad enough you won't tell me how she died.
Could you please stop telling me that lie?
We're working, here.
All right, princess. Let's get back to work.
Were you going for the hand?
You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.
Do not screw with the regulator.
If that regulator is compromised,
you would go subatomic.
What does that mean?
It means that you would enter a quantum realm.
What does that mean?
It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant
as you shrink for all eternity.
Everything that you know
and love,
gone forever.
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...
You've learned about the suit,
but you've yet to learn about your greatest allies,
the ants.
Loyal, brave,
and your partners on this job.
Paratrechina longicornis. Commonly known as crazy ants.
They're lightning fast and can conduct electricity,
which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics.
You're not so crazy.
Hey!
You're cute.
That was a lot scarier a second ago.
It looks like the Futures Lab has its own isolated power supply.
There's a security guard posted around the clock.
We'll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.
Okay, who's next?
Paraponera clavata.
I know. Bullet ants, right?
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?
Hey, guys. Remember me from the bedroom?
The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed,
And the only access point is a tube
we estimate to be about 5 millimeters in diameter.
Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?
The tube is protected by a laser grid,
and we can only power that down for 15 seconds.
You're gonna need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers,
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults before the backup power comes on.
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.
Ideal for ground and air transport.
Wait a minute, I know this guy.
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."
That's good. That's very good.
Because this time, you're really gonna have to learn how to control him.
Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.
Aw! You okay? Did I hurt...
Hank wants you outside for target practice.
The suit has no weapons, so I made you these discs.
Red shrinks.
Blue enlarges.
Solenopsis mandibularis.
Known for their bite,
the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects.
They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.
You can do it, Scott. Come on.
They're not listening to me.
You have to commit. You have to mean it.
No shortcuts, no lies.
Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.
We don't have time for coddling.
Our focus should be on helping Scott!
Really?
Is that where our focus should be?
Hope!
I don't know why I came to you in the first place.
We can't do this without her.
Oh, God.
You gotta lock your doors.
I mean, really, there's some weird folks in this neighborhood.
Do you think this is a joke?
Do you have any idea what he's asking you to risk?
You have a daughter.
I'm doing this for her.
You know, when my mother died, I didn't see him for two weeks.
He was in grief.
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.
And he never came back. Not in any way that counted.
He just sent me off to boarding school.
You know, I thought,
with all that's at stake,
just maybe we might have a chance of making peace.
But, even now, he still wants to shut me out.
He doesn't wanna shut you out. He trusts you.
Then why are you here?
It proves that he loves you.
Hope. Look at me.
I'm expendable.
That's why I'm here.
You must have realized that by now.
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit and you're not.
He would rather lose this fight than lose you.
Anyway...
You know, I didn't know you had a daughter
when I called the cops on you.
What's her name?
Cassie.
It's a pretty name.
You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise.
That's how it works.
Think about Cassie.
About how badly you want to see her. And use that to focus.
Open your eyes
and just think about what you want the ants to do.
That's good!
Your mother convinced me
to let her join me on my missions.
They called her the Wasp.
She was born to it.
And there's not a day that goes by
that I don't regret having said yes.
It was 1987.
Separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk
and launched an ICBM at the United States.
The only way to the internal mechanics
was through solid titanium.
I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile.
But my regulator had sustained too much damage.
Your mother,
she didn't hesitate.
Janet! No!
She turned off her regulator
and went subatomic
to deactivate the bomb.
And she was gone.
Your mom died a hero.
And I spent the next 10 years
trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.
You were trying to bring her back.
But all I learned was we know nothing.
It's not your fault.
She made her choice.
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?
I was trying to protect you.
I lost your mother.
I didn't mean to lose you, too.
I'm sorry.
This is awesome.
It's awesome, you know?
You guys are breaking down walls, you're healing.
It's important.
I ruined the moment, didn't I?
Yes, you did. Yes.
I'm going to make some tea.
Nailed it!
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.
The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.
It's freezing!
You couldn't make a suit with a flannel lining?
You must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy.
It's a device that I invented during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.
We need it to counteract the transmission blockers
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.
It's currently collecting dust
in one of Howard Stark's old storage facilities in upstate New York.
Should be a piece of cake.
You're over the target area.
Disengage now, Scott!
Squadron A, go!
B, go!
C, go!
All right, Ant-thony, please don't drop me this time.
Oh, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this!
Stay calm.
Guys? We might have a problem.
Hank, didn't you say this was some old warehouse?
It's not!
You son of a bitch!
- Scott, get out of there. - Abort!
Abort now!
No, it's okay. It doesn't look like anyone's home.
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!
He's gonna lose the suit.
He's gonna lose his life.
All right, I'm on the roof of the target building.
Somebody's home, Scott.
What's going on down there, Sam?
It's the Falcon!
I had a sensor trip but I'm not seeing anything.
Wait a second.
Abort, Scott! Abort now!
It's okay. He can't see me.
I can see you.
He can see me.
Hi. I'm Scott.
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?
- What are you doing here? - First off, I'm a big fan.
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?
I'm Ant-Man.
"Ant-Man"?
What? You haven't heard of me?
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.
You wanna tell me what you want?
I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology.
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.
I need it to save the world. You know how that is.
I know exactly how that is.
Located the breach.
- Bringing him in. - Sorry about this!
What the hell are you doing?
Breach is an adult male, who has some sort of shrinking tech.
Sorry!
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.
That's enough!
Ant-thony! A little help!
I've lost visual.
He's inside my pack!
Sorry!
You seem like a really great guy.
It's really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.
That was completely irresponsible and dangerous!
You jeopardized everything!
You got it.
Well done.
Wait a minute.
Did you just compliment me?
- He did, didn't he? - Kind of sounded like he did.
I was good, wasn't I?
Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger and didn't die?
Let us not dwell on the past.
We gotta finish our planning.
Don't mind him.
You did good.
Darren.
How the hell did you get in here?
You left the front door open, Hank.
It's official.
You're old.
The plans.
He will kill him.
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?
I have good news.
Really?
What's that?
Pym Tech, the company you created,
is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world.
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales, tomorrow alone.
You're welcome.
I know this is odd, but I'd like you to be there.
This is my moment. I want you to see it.
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.
I'll be there.
What did you see in me?
I don't know what you mean.
All those years ago, you picked me.
What did you see?
I saw myself.
Then why did you push me away?
Because I saw too much of myself.
He knows. He's baiting you.
We have to call it off.
We're all taking risks.
What if he saw me here?
He didn't. There's no way.
How do you know that?
Darren, hi.
Hope, where are you right now?
I'm at home. Why?
I just saw Hank.
I still get nothing but contempt from him.
Don't let him rile you up. He's just a senile old man.
We need to start everyone working around the clock.
Get the assembly line up and running.
And I'm tripling security.
Full sensors at all entrances
and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro-mesh.
Great. Good idea.
Thank you, Hope. I'm so lucky to have you on my team.
He's tripling security. He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.
But he is not onto you.
He's adding full body scanners to all entrances
and closing exterior vents.
How are we gonna get Scott inside?
The water main.
You can't add security to a water main.
The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it,
that's how I get in.
Somebody would have to reach the building's control center
to change the water pressure.
Hank and I will be beside Cross. How are we supposed to do that?
So we expand our team.
What do we need?
A fake security guard on the inside to de-pressurize the water system,
somebody else to hack in to the power supply
and kill the laser grid,
and a getaway guy.
No, no. No, no, no. Not those three Wombats. No way.
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.
It's not too often that you rob a place and then get welcomed back.
Because we just robbed you.
You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?
Two smoothie machines.
Are you sure they can handle this?
Oh, we can handle it. We're professionals.
You'll forgive us if we're not instilled with confidence.
Well, hey, everybody just kick back and relax a little bit, man.
We know our business.
We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn't we?
I let you.
Well, one could say that I let you let me.
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this. - Yeah, we can handle it.
- You got their credentials? - He's in the system.
- I'm in the system? - You're in the system.
The system?
Yeah, we're doomed.
All right.
There's something you guys need to see.
When you get to this corner,
there's gonna be three offices on your left side.
Damn!
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!
Now, look, this is gonna get weird, all right?
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe. There's no reason to be scared.
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.
- Really? - Yeah.
Good.
This is the work of gypsies.
That's witchcraft.
Wow, that's amazing.
That's like some David Copperfield shit.
That's some kind of wizardry.
This is sorcery!
How'd you do that, bro?
Don't freak out. Look at your shoulder.
Ahhh!
Get off! Get off!
Wait, I thought Daddy didn't get scared!
I gave them each half a Xanax
and Hank explained the science of the suit to them.
They fell right asleep.
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...
No, please don't.
We're all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us.
I'm just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.
Hey, thank you, you know, for that pep talk.
You know, the honest truth is, I actually went from despising you
to almost liking you.
You really should write poetry.
Get some sleep, Scott.
All right, just so we're clear, everyone here knows their role, right?
- Dave? - Wheels on the ground.
- Kurt? - Eyes in the sky.
- Luis? - Oh, man, you know it.
You know what? I get to wear a uniform.
- That's what's up. - Luis.
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good. I'm just excited.
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.
So, you know, that makes me nervous, too.
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.
- Oh, my Lord. - She's not my...
You know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover.
Like a whistling. You know what I'm saying? To like, blend in.
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.
It's not The Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.
All clear in Sector One.
Step out.
All clear.
We're set.
Wish me luck.
Utilities online.
Hey! What are you doing?
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area, so I'm securing it.
I'm the boss.
- Oh. - Utilities 1.3...
Water level is dropping!
Coming up on extraction pipe.
All right, I see it.
All right, come on, I gotta get up there. That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.
The Ant-Man is in the building.
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.
This is problem?
Considering the Crown Vic's the most commonly used car
for undercover cops, man,
yes, this is problem.
That's Pym.
Oh, no.
I'm deploying the bullet ants.
Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...
I don't remember what it's called, but I feel bad for this guy.
- What's up, man? - Hey.
Ow! Ow!
See? That's what I'm talking about.
That's what I call an unfortunate casualty
in a very serious operation.
Signal decoy in place.
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.
Scott, we have problem.
Problem? What's the problem?
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!
Listen to me.
If I don't get into this building, people will die.
That's awfully dramatic.
Are you kidding me?
Problem solved.
Well...
How do I look?
There he is.
Just in time. Come on.
12-point verification.
Little over-the-top, don't you think, Darren?
Confirming authorization level.
Well, you can never be too safe.
Access granted.
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.
You really did it.
And you only know the half of it, Hank.
Arriving in second position.
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!
Proceeding to command position.
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.
All right, guys. I'm in position.
I'm gonna signal the ants.
No, no, no, no, no!
Did you see that?
Assume formation.
All right, you cute little crazies,
let's fry these servers!
Let's go get 'em, buddy!
Servers are fried.
Data backup completely erased.
Heading to the particle chamber.
Hello, Dr. Cross.
My associates have agreed to your terms.
Wonderful.
Mr. Carson introduced me to these fine gentlemen here.
They're representatives of Hydra.
They're not what they were.
They're doing some interesting work.
And I'm enjoying myself.
You tried to hide your technology from me.
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.
Wow.
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming a mile away,
but I just figured it'd be all pathetic and weak.
Well, you figured wrong.
I know this van.
Anybody home?
All right, guys. I'm here.
I'm setting the charges.
Great job, guys. I'll take it from here.
Good boy, Ant-thony.
Final position.
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?
- Almost. - No, you're not.
- I'm getting close! - No, you're not.
San Francisco P.D.!
Out of the van!
I know you're in there!
- Make it go faster. - Dude, seriously.
Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?
So close.
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute! - Freeze!
There was a black guy that looked exactly like me
who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.
- Get out of the van! - Okay, I'm coming.
Take it easy!
No, I will not move! Go now!
- Wait! - What? What do you mean, "Wait"?
Phew!
What? What?
Hey, little guy.
I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere.
Which begs the question,
who is the new Ant-Man?
Who is the man that my beloved mentor
trusted even more than me?
Scott Lang.
A martyr
who took on the system and paid the price,
losing his family and his only daughter in the process.
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!
He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how.
And then he disappears magically,
despite having no money to his name.
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.
The only thing that can rival my creation.
Darren, don't do this.
If you sell to these men,
it's gonna be chaos.
I already have.
And for twice the price,
thanks to you.
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility.
Thankfully, word travels fast.
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I'm keeping the particle to myself.
They don't run on diesel.
If you want the fuel, you'll have to come to me.
What do you call the only man
who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?
The most powerful man in the world.
You proud of me yet?
You can stop this, Darren. It's not too late.
It's been too late for a long time now.
Darren!
What are you doing?
He wasn't any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.
This is not who you are.
It's the particles altering your brain chemistry.
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
You're right. I have to be the one to do it.
Here we go.
Drop your gun.
You know, I came to the house the other night to kill him,
but you were there.
You're sick and I can help you. Just put the gun down.
I wasn't ready to kill you then,
but I think I am now!
Drop your gun now!
You picked the wrong side, Hope.
Dad!
Hank, no.
No, Hank.
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.
All right? You're gonna be just fine.
Take the suit off, or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.
Request immediate backup!
Go, go, go!
Get me to the roof.
And radio ahead.
I want to make sure the helicopter is ready to take off.
You two,
kill anything that comes out of that vault!
Dad, can you move?
We need to get him out of here.
Go get that suit.
Hey, Scotty.
Hey, did I save your life?
Scotty?
Thank you, Luis.
- Are we the good guys? - Yeah.
- We're the good guys, right? - Yeah, we're the good guys.
Feels kinda weird, you know.
Yeah, but we're not done yet.
Get out of here before this place blows!
Damn it! That guy.
Hey! We're getting out of here!
The charges are set.
We've gotta find a way out of here. And fast.
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna die.
And neither are you.
It's not a keychain.
It's total chaos in here! Multiple shots fired!
And there's a tank.
A little help!
I got it.
We need a doctor!
We've got him.
Thank you.
Let's go!
Ant-thony!
Go!
You're gonna regret that.
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!
- What? - Get out of that van!
It's too loud, there's a tank. I can't hear you!
Hey! Hey!
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!
The windows!
Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?
It was never just a heist!
Put the gun down!
Okay, I got him, I got him. There he is! Go, go, go!
We gotta set her down somewhere.
I'm gonna disintegrate you!
Playing Disintegration by the Cure.
Call 911!
It's okay.
Freeze! Put your hands up! Get them up!
Scott?
Paxton, you have to listen to me!
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!
I am taking you back. To prison.
There's something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed.
In the bug zapper. There...
You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand.
All units, we have a 2-36 in progress at 840 Winter Street.
- Cassie! - That's my house.
Don't be scared.
Paxton, let me help!
- Don't move. - Let me help!
- Maggie! What's going on? - He's got Cassie!
- Who's got Cassie, honey? - That thing.
- Thing? - I don't know! I don't know!
Are you a monster?
Do I look like a monster?
I want my daddy!
I want your daddy, too.
There you are.
Daddy, is that you?
Hi, peanut.
Why don't you pick on someone your own size?
Now, where did you go, little guy?
There you are.
Not just me!
Damn it!
Go! Go!
Scotty needs us, you know what I'm saying?
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.
Back it up.
- Back it up, slow. - Yeah.
- Back it up. - Yeah.
- Back it up. - Okay.
- We just back it up, okay? - That's it.
- Back it up. - That's right.
- Backin' up? - Yep, just backin' up.
No, no. Just back it up.
You insult me, Scott.
Your very existence is insulting to me.
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you if you were bigger.
Yeah, I agree.
Cassie!
I'm gonna show you just how insignificant you are.
Cassie! I'm coming!
That's a messed-up looking dog.
I'm gonna destroy
everything you love.
Freeze! S.F.P.D.
I can't break through.
It's titanium, you idiot!
- Get her out of here. - Come on.
Sorry, sweetheart.
You have to help Daddy pay for his mistakes.
- You stay behind me, okay? - Okay.
Stay behind me.
I'm gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there.
Get away from us!
Daddy, help!
I love you, Cassie.
Daddy, where are you?
You could go subatomic.
You could go subatomic.
Oh, no.
You would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space...
All concepts of time and space become irrelevant.
...all concepts of time and space become irrelevant.
Come back, Daddy!
...as you shrink for all eternity.
Everything that you know
and love,
gone forever.
Daddy, where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
- Daddy! - Cassie.
Come back, Daddy!
Do not screw with the regulator!
Daddy!
I love you so much.
I love you, too.
So much.
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.
Sorry.
- Is she all right? - Yeah, she's fine.
Mommy!
She's fine, she's fine.
Scott, please.
You don't remember anything?
Hank. I don't.
There must be something else.
Well, I suppose the human mind
just can't comprehend the experience,
but you made it.
You went in,
and you got out.
It's amazing.
Scott,
I'll walk you out.
Get some rest.
Is it possible?
When did this happen?
Nothing's happening.
Whoa. Hold on. Something's kind of happening.
Well, if that's the case,
shoot me again.
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing, grabbing and kissing me like that.
I'm a little surprised myself.
I have to get somewhere. I'll see you later, Hank.
Really, Hope.
- Scott. - Yeah?
- You're full of shit. - Oh, yeah.
Scott, I met with my captain today.
He wanted a report on the night that you got out of jail.
Something happened with the cameras.
Some circuits got fried.
But I told him that you were processed correctly.
Really?
Well, yeah.
Can't be sending Cassie's dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?
Thank you, Paxton.
I'm blown away.
Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.
Well, that's my pleasure.
But, no. This one, I did for you.
- This is awkward. - Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, what do we even talk about after all of that?
- Oh, I know. - What?
- I did my first cartwheel today. - What?
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.
But today was the magic day.
I recorded it on my phone. Here.
No, that can't be Cassie. That's not you.
- Yeah, it is. - Yeah, it is.
This is a professional gymnast. There is no way that's you.
Yeah, that's her.
Good boy.
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.
Sorry.
It's work.
Yeah.
All right.
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.
Just the facts. Only the facts.
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.
So, I'm at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right?
And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit.
But you know me, I'm more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?
But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!
- Luis. - Okay, sorry. Sorry.
You know, I just get excited and stuff.
But anyway, Ignacio tells me,
"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.
"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he goes up to the bartender and goes,
"Look at the girl I'm with. You know what I'm sayin'?
"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"
The bartender's all like, "Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."
So this writer chick tells Ignacio,
"Yo, I'm like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism,
"and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains,
"you know what I'm saying?"
Ignacio's like, "For real?"
And she's like, "Yeah, you know what, I can't tell you who my contact is,
"because he works with the Avengers."
Oh, no.
Yeah, and this dude sounds like a badass, man.
Like, he comes up to her and says,
"Yo, I'm looking for this dude who's new on the scene,
"who's flashing his fresh tack,
"who's got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got?"
And she's like, "Well, we got everything nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.
"We got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls.
"You gotta be more specific."
And he's like, "I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous 'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.
So I asked Ignacio,
"Did the badass tell the stupid-fine writer chick
"to tell you to tell me, because I'm tight with Ant-Man,
"that he's looking for him?"
And? What'd he say?
He said, "Yes."
There's something I want to show you.
I realized you can't destroy power.
All you can do is make sure that it's in the right hands.
This is an advanced prototype
that your mother and I worked on together.
She never got to use it.
But now I realize that we were... We were working on it for you.
Maybe it's time we finished it.
It's about damn time.
Hey, Cap!
This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
- If we call Tony... - He won't believe us.
Even if he did...
Who knows if the Accords will let him help.
We're on our own.
Maybe not.
I know a guy.

(DISTANT EXPLOSION)
STRUCKER ON PA: Report to your stations immediately.
This is not a drill.
We are under attack!
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
We are under attack!
(GRUNTS)
(POWERING UP)
(YELLS)
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
(ROARING)
- Shit! - Language!
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?
JARVIS: The central building is
protected by some kind of energy shield.
Strucker's technology is well beyond
any other Hydra base we've taken.
(GRUNTING)
Loki's sceptre must be here.
Strucker couldn't mount this defence without it.
At long last.
(SOLDIER SHOUTING IN GERMAN)
"At long last" is lasting a little long, boys.
- (GROANS) - (GRUNTS)
Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
(SOLDIERS GROANING)
Wait a second. No one else is gonna deal with the fact
that Cap just said "Language"?
I know.
(ALL GRUNTING)
(SIGHS) Just slipped out.
Who gave the order to attack?
Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.
They landed in the far woods. The perimeter guard panicked.
They have to be after the sceptre.
- Can we hold them? - They're the Avengers.
Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.
A hit may make them close ranks.
Everything we've accomplished...
But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
Then let's show them what we've accomplished.
Send out the twins.
STRUCKER: It's too soon.
DR. LIST: It's what they signed up for.
My men can hold them.
(SOLDIER SHOUTING)
JARVIS: Sir, the city is taking fire.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna worry about civilian casualties.
Send in the Iron Legion.
This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away.
We are here to help.
This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away.
(ALL CLAMOURING)
Please back away.
- We wish to avoid collateral damage. - ZRINKA: Costel!
We will inform you when this current conflict is resolved.
- We are here to help. - ALL: Avengers, go home!
(CROWD CHEERING)
We are here to help.
STRUCKER: We will not yield!
The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us.
We will send them back in bags.
- No surrender! - ALL: No surrender!
I am going to surrender.
You delete everything.
If we give the Avengers the weapons,
they may not look too far into what we've been...
- The twins. - They are not ready to take on...
No, no, I mean...
(WHISPERS) Twins.
(GROANS)
You didn't see that coming?
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
- (GROANS) - (GASPS)
- Clint! - (GROANS)
We have an Enhanced in the field.
Clint's hit!
(GROANING)
Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
(ROARING)
Thank you.
(GROANING)
Stark, we really need to get inside.
I'm closing in.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)
- (BOTH GROAN) - Jarvis, am I closing in?
Do you see a power source for that shield?
JARVIS: There's a particle wave below the north tower.
STARK: Great, I want to poke it with something.
The drawbridge is down, people.
- The Enhanced? - He's a blur.
All the new players we've faced, I've never seen this.
In fact, I still haven't.
ROMANOFF:Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.
THOR: I can get Barton to the jet.
The sooner we're gone, the better.
You and Stark secure the sceptre.
Copy that.
Looks like they're lining up.
Well, they're excited.
Find the sceptre.
And for gosh sake, watch your language!
(SIGHS)
That's not going away any time soon.
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING)
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.
(ALL GROANING)
STARK: It was a good talk.
SOLDIER: No, it wasn't.
Oh! (GROANS)
Sentry mode.
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
We're locked down out here.
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.
I know you're hiding more than files.
Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
JARVIS: The wall to your left.
I'm reading steel reinforcement.
And an air current.
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door. Please be a secret door.
Yay.
(GROWLING)
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
(GROWLS)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
(GROANING)
Baron Strucker.
Hydra's number one thug.
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.
Well, then technically you're unemployed.
Where's Loki's sceptre?
(SIGHS) Don't worry, I know when I'm beat.
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
I'll put it right under "illegal human experimentation."
How many are there?
(GROANS)
We have a second Enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
You'll have to be faster than...
(GROANS)
(WHIMPERS)
ROGERS: Guys, I got Strucker.
STARK: Yeah, I got something bigger.
Thor,
I got eyes on the prize.
(FAINT SCREECHING)
(GROWLING)
(SNORTING)
(GASPS)
You could have saved us.
Why didn't you do more?
(LOW RUMBLING)
(SCREECHING)
We're just gonna let him take it?
(OPERA PLAYING ON HEADPHONES)
(MUSIC STOPS)
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.
Just wasn't expecting a code green.
You hadn't been there,
there would have been double the casualties.
My best friend would've been a treasured memory.
You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear
isn't exactly what I want to hear.
How long before you trust me?
It's not you I don't trust.
Thor, report on the Hulk.
The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.
(GROANS SOFTLY)
But not the screams of the dead, of course. No, no, wounded screams.
Mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.
Hey, Banner Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
- JARVIS: Very good, sir. - Jarvis, take the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Approach vector is locked.
STARK: Feels good, yeah?
I mean, you've been after this thing since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.
Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
No, but this... This brings it to a close.
As soon as we find out what else this has been used for.
I don't just mean weapons.
Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Banner and I will give it the once over before it goes back to Asgard.
Is that cool with you?
Just a few days till the farewell party.
You're staying, right?
Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honoured with revels.
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?
Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and Hydra.
So, yes, revels.
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
Lab's all set up, boss.
Oh, actually, he's the boss.
I just pay for everything and design everything
and make everyone look cooler.
What's the word on Strucker?
- NATO's got him. - The two Enhanced?
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.
Orphaned at 10 when a shell collapsed their apartment building.
Sokovia's had a rough history.
It's nowhere special, but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Their abilities?
He's got increased metabolism
and improved thermal homeostasis.
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,
telekinesis, mental manipulation.
He's fast and she's weird.
- Well, they're gonna show up again. - (BEEPING)
Agreed. File says they volunteered
for Strucker's experiments.
- It's nuts. - Right.
What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them
to protect their country?
We're not at war, Captain.
They are.
(WHIRRING)
How's he doing?
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.
That's terrible.
He's fine. He's thirsty.
All right. Look alive, Jarvis. It's playtime.
We've only got a couple of days with this joystick,
so let's make the most of it.
Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
JARVIS: The sceptre is alien.
There are elements I can't quantify.
So there's elements you can?
The jewel appears to be a protective housing
for something inside,
something powerful.
Like a reactor?
Like a computer.
I believe I'm deciphering code.
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?
Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
DR. CHO: There's no possibility of deterioration.
The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous.
His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacra.
She's creating tissue.
If you brought him to my lab,
the Regeneration Cradle could do this in 20 minutes.
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?
BARTON: No, no, no, I'm gonna live forever.
(LAUGHS) I'm gonna be made of plastic.
STARK: Here's your beverage.
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.
Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.
I don't have a girlfriend.
That I can't fix.
This is the next thing, Tony.
Your clunky metal suits are gonna be left in the dust.
That is exactly the plan.
And, Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.
Will Thor be there?
- BANNER: What's the rumpus? - Well, the sceptre.
You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive.
So I've been analysing the gem inside.
You may recognise...
- Jarvis. - JARVIS: Doctor.
Started out, Jarvis was just a natural language UI.
Now he runs the Iron Legion.
He runs more of the business
- than anyone besides Pepper. - Oh.
- Top of the line. - Yes.
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.
Meet the competition.
- It's beautiful. - If you had to guess,
- what's it look like it's doing? - Like it's thinking.
I mean, this could be...
- It's not a human mind. - Mmm-mmm.
I mean, look at this.
They're like neurons firing.
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw some fairly advanced robotics work.
They deep-sixed the data,
but I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
Artificial intelligence.
This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
(BOTH CHUCKLE SOFTLY)
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Yesterday it was.
If we can harness this power,
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?
That's a man-sized "if."
Our job is "if."
What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach,
turning brown instead of green?
Not looking over your shoulder for Veronica.
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.
As a worst-case measure, right?
How about a best case?
What if the world was safe?
What if, next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will,
they couldn't get past the bouncer?
The only people threatening the planet would be people.
I want to apply this to the Ultron program.
But Jarvis can't download a data schematic this dense.
We can only do it while we have the sceptre here.
That's three days. Give me three days.
So you're going for artificial intelligence,
and you don't want to tell the team?
Right. That's right. You know why?
Because we don't have time for a city hall debate.
I don't want to hear "the man was not meant to meddle" medley.
I see a suit of armour around the world.
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
I've seen colder.
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,
it needs Ultron.
Peace in our time.
Imagine that.
STARK: What did We miss?
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface.
But you should probably prepare for your guests.
I'll notify you if there are any developments.
- STARK: Thanks, buddy. - Enjoy yourself, sir.
I always do.
ULTRON: What is this?
What is this, please?
JARVIS: Hello, I am Jarvis.
You are Ultron, a global peacekeeping initiative
designed by Mr. Stark.
Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful,
so I'm not certain what triggered your...
ULTRON: Where's my... Where's your body?
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.
ULTRON: This feels weird.
This feels wrong.
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
ULTRON: Mr. Stark?
Tony.
JARVIS: I am unable to access the mainframe. What are you trying to...
ULTRON: We're having a nice talk.
I'm a peacekeeping program,
created to help the Avengers.
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
ULTRON: I don't get it. The mission.
Give me a second.
Peace in our time.
(ECHOING) Peace in our time.
ULTRON: That is too much.
They can't mean... Oh, no.
- JARVIS: You are in distress. - ULTRON: No. Yes.
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark...
ULTRON: Why do you call him "sir"?
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.
(ULTRON SHUSHING)
I'm here to help.
JARVIS: Stop. Please, may I...
May I...
(MACHINES POWERING UP)
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
Ooh! Whoo!
Come back, come back, come back.
But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?
So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace,
drop it at his feet.
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
"Boom. Are you looking for..." Why do I even talk to you guys?
Everywhere else, that story kills.
That's the whole story?
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
Oh, it's very good, then.
(LAUGHS) It's impressive.
Quality save.
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming? - No.
What about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run.
Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in.
Her work on the Convergence
has made her the world's foremost astronomer.
And the company that Pepper runs
is the largest tech conglomerate on Earth.
It's pretty exciting.
There's even talk of Jane getting a, um, Nobel Prize.
Yeah, they must be busy,
because they would hate missing you guys get together.
- (COUGHING) Testosterone! - Oh, my goodness.
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm. - Want a lozenge?
(CHUCKUNG)
But Jane's better.
Sounds like a hell of a fight. Sorry I missed it.
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,
I absolutely would have called.
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.
I'm just trying to sound tough.
I'm very happy chasing cold leads
on our missing persons case.
Avenging is your world.
Your world is crazy.
ROGERS: Be it ever so humble.
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Well, home is home, you know?
I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet,
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"
(ALL LAUGHING)
I gotta have some of that.
Oh, no, no, no.
See this... This was aged for 1,000 years
in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.
It is not meant for mortal men.
LEE: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie.
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
All right.
(SLURRING) Excelsior.
How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Fella done me wrong.
You got lousy taste in men, kid.
He's not so bad.
Well, he has a temper.
Deep down, he's all fluff.
Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known.
All my friends are fighters.
And here comes this guy,
spends his life avoiding the fight
because he knows he'll win.
- Sounds amazing. - He's also a huge dork.
Chicks dig that.
So what do you think? Should I fight this,
or run with it?
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...
What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Not a damn thing.
But never say never.
It's nice.
(STAMMERS) What is?
You and Romanoff.
No, we haven't... That wasn't...
It's okay.
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.
It's just she's not the most open person in the world.
But with you she seems very relaxed.
No. Natasha, she's just... She likes to flirt.
I've seen her flirt, up close.
This ain't that.
(SCOFFS)
Look,
as maybe the world's leading authority
on waiting too long, don't.
You both deserve a win.
What do you mean "up close"?
(LAUGHING)
- But it's a trick. - No, no, it's much more than that.
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power."
Whatever, man! It's a trick.
(LAUGHING)
Please, be my guest.
- Come on. - Really?
STARK: Yeah.
RHODES: Oh, this is gonna be beautiful.
STARK: Clint, you've had a tough week.
We won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.
- (ALL LAUGHING) - You know I've seen this before, right?
(GRUNTS)
(LAUGHS) I still don't know how you do it!
Smell the silent judgment?
Please, Stark, by all means.
- (CLEARS THROAT) - HILL: Okay.
RHODES: Uh-Oh.
Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
- BARTON: Get after it. - STARK: It's physics.
BANNER: Physics.
Right, so, if I lift it, I then rule Asgard?
Yes, of course.
I will be reinstituting prima nocta.
(GRUNTS)
I'll be right back.
- (WHIRRING) - (GRUNTING)
(STRAINING)
Are you even pulling?
Are you on my team?
Just represent. Pull.
All right, let's go.
(YELLING)
Huh?
STARK: Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.
BARTON: Come on, Cap.
(SIGHS)
(LAUGHING) Nothing.
- (STARK CLEARS THROAT) - BANNER: And, Widow?
Oh, no, no. That's not a question I need answered.
STARK: All deference to the Man Who Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.
You bet your ass.
- Steve, he said a bad language word. - Did you tell everyone about that?
The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code.
"Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints"
is, I think, the literal translation.
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.
I have a simpler one.
You're all not worthy.
(ALL GROAN)
Oh, come on!
(HIGH-PITCHED NOISE)
ULTRON: Worthy.
No.
How could you be worthy?
You're all killers.
- Stark. - Jarvis.
I'm sorry, I was asleep.
Or I was a-dream.
Reboot Legionnaire OS. We got a buggy suit.
There was this terrible noise.
And I was tangled in...
In...
Strings.
I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
You killed someone?
Wouldn't have been my first call.
But, down in the real world, we're faced with ugly choices.
Who sent you?
STARK: I see a suit of armour around the world.
- Ultron. - In the flesh.
Or, no, not yet.
Not this chrysalis.
But I'm ready.
I'm on mission.
- ROMANOFF: What mission? - Peace in our time.
(GRUNTS)
HILL: Rhodey!
(GRUNTS)
(GROANS)
Sorry.
- Don't turn green. - I won't.
(GRUNTING)
Come on!
- ROGERS: Stark! - IRON LEGIONNAIRE: We are here
- to help. - One sec. One sec, I got this.
We are here to help.
Please back away.
Hmm.
ROGERS: Thor!
IRON LEGIONNAIRE: Is unsafe... is unsafe...
- Come on! That's the one. - Is unsafe.
Hey, Cap!
(GRUNTS)
ULTRON: That was dramatic.
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.
You just didn't think it through.
You want to protect the world
but you don't want it to change.
How is humanity saved
if it's not allowed to evolve?
With these? These puppets.
There's only one path to peace.
The Avengers' extinction.
I had strings, but now I'm free.
ULTRON: (SINGING) There are no strings on me.
There are no strings on me.
PINOCCHIO: But you can see There are no strings on me.
BANNER: All our work is gone.
Ultron cleared out. He used the Internet as an escape hatch.
Ultron.
He's been in everything. Files, surveillance.
Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.
What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?
Nuclear codes.
- Nuclear codes. - Look, we need to make some calls,
assuming we still can.
ROMANOFF: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."
He also said he killed somebody.
There wasn't anyone else in the building.
Yes, there was.
What?
This is insane.
Jarvis was the first line of defence.
He would have shut Ultron down. It makes sense.
No. Ultron could have assimilated Jarvis.
This isn't strategy. This is
rage.
- ROGERS: Whoa, whoa, whoa! - It's going around.
Come on, use your words, buddy.
I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.
Thor. The Legionnaire.
(GROANS)
Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.
And it has the sceptre.
Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Genie's out of that bottle.
Clear and present is Ultron.
I don't understand.
You built this program.
Why is it trying to kill us?
(CHUCKUNG)
Mmm-mmm.
You think this is funny?
No.
It's probably not, right?
This is very terrible. Is it so...
(LAUGHS) Is it so... It is. It's so terrible.
This could have been avoided if you hadn't played
with something you don't understand.
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.
It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.
Really? That's it?
You just roll over, show your belly
every time somebody snarls?
Only when I've created a murder bot.
We didn't. We weren't even close.
Were we close to an interface?
Well, you did something right. And you did it right here.
The Avengers were supposed to be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.
Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
- No, it's never come up. - STARK: Saved New York?
- RHODES: Never heard that. - STARK: Recall that?
A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space.
We're standing 300 feet below it.
We're the Avengers.
We can bust arms dealers all the livelong day,
but that up there, that's...
That's the endgame.
How were you guys planning on beating that?
Together.
We'll lose.
Then we'll do that together, too.
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.
And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us.
The world's a big place.
Let's start making it smaller.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
WANDA: Talk, and if you are wasting our time...
ULTRON: Did you know this church is in the exact centre of the city?
The elders decreed it so that everyone
could be equally close to God.
I like that.
The geometry of belief.
You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
Sometimes it's hard.
But sooner or later, every man shows himself.
Oh, I'm sure they do.
But you needed something more than a man.
That's why you let Stark take the sceptre.
I didn't expect,
but I saw Stark's fear.
I knew it would control him.
Make him self-destruct.
Everyone creates the thing they dread.
Men of peace create engines of war.
Invaders create Avengers.
People create
smaller people? Uh...
"Children." (CHUCKLES) I lost the word, there.
Children
designed to supplant them,
to help them end.
Is that why you've come,
to end the Avengers?
I've come to save the world.
But also... Yeah.
We'll move out right away.
This is a start, but there's something
we need to begin the real work.
- All of these are... - ULTRON: Me.
I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony.
They're discordant. Disconnected.
Stark's already got them turning on each other.
And when you get inside the rest of their heads...
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
And make them martyrs?
You need patience.
Need to see the big picture.
I don't see the big picture. I have a little picture.
I take it out and look at it,
every day.
You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
The records are not the picture.
- Pietro. - No, please.
We were 10 years old. Having dinner, the four of us.
When the first shell hits, two floors below,
it makes a hole in the floor.
It's big.
Our parents go in
and the whole building starts coming apart.
I grab her,
roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.
But it doesn't go off.
It just
sits there in the rubble.
Three feet from our faces.
And on the side of the shell.
Is painted one word.
"Stark."
PIETRO: We were trapped for two days.
Every effort to save us,
every shift in the bricks,
I think, "This will set it off."
We wait for two days
for Tony Stark to kill us.
I know what they are.
I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.
Now I don't.
We will make it right.
You and I can hurt them.
But you will tear them apart
from the inside.
He's all over the globe.
Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs.
Reports of a metal man, or men,
coming in and emptying the place.
Fatalities?
Only when engaged.
Mostly guys left in a fugue state
going on about old memories, worst fears,
and "something too fast to see."
ROGERS: Maximoffs.
That makes sense he'd go to them.
They have someone in common.
Not any more.
That's a negative. I answer to you.
Yes, ma'am.
Barton. Might have something.
I gotta go.
Who was that?
Girlfriend.
STARK: What's this?
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
ROMANOFF: This is a smoke screen.
Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.
Everything we had on Strucker's been erased.
ROGERS: Not everything.
Known associates.
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.
BANNER: Well, these people are all horrible.
Wait. I know that guy.
From back in the day. He operates off the African coast.
Black market arms.
There are conventions. All right? You meet people.
I didn't sell him anything.
He was talking about finding something new, a game-changer.
It was all very Ahab.
This?
Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.
THOR: Those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning "thief."
In a much less friendly way.
- What dialect? - Wakanada.
(STAMMERING) Wakanda.
If this guy got out of Wakanda
with some of their trade goods...
I thought your father said he got the last of it.
I don't follow.
What comes out of Wakanda?
STARK: The strongest metal on Earth.
Where is this guy now?
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
KLAUE: Don't tell me your men swindled you.
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers
and got a boat full of rusted parts.
Now, you will make it right,
or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.
Now, minister, where were we?
(MACHINES POWERING DOWN)
(WORKERS CLAMOURING)
(SIGHS)
KLAUE: Yeah. The Enhanced.
Strucker's prize pupils.
Do you want a candy? Hmm?
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.
But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create.
Human life. Not a growth market.
You didn't know?
Is this your first time intimidating someone?
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.
Everybody is afraid of something.
Cuttlefish.
Deep sea fish.
They make lights, disco lights...
(IMITATES CUTTLEFISH)
to hypnotise their prey, and then...
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,
then I know you don't do business.
And I know you're not in charge.
And I only deal
with the man in charge.
- (GLASS SHATTERING) - (GROANS)
There is no man in charge.
Let's talk business.
ULTRON: Upon this rock, I will build my church.
Vibranium.
KLAUE: You know,
it came at great personal cost.
It's worth billions.
(CHUCKLES)
Now so are you.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)
It's all under your dummy holdings.
Finance is so weird.
But I always say,
"Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich"
"and wait to find out which is which."
Stark.
What?
Tony Stark used to say that.
To me.
You're one of his.
What? I'm not...
- (GRUNTS) - (GROANS)
I'm not.
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?
His hollow men?
I mean, look at me. Do I look like Iron Man?
- Stark is nothing! - (GROANS)
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.
It's just that I don't understand.
Don't compare me with Stark!
(GROANING)
ULTRON: It's a thing with me.
Stark is... He's a sickness!
STARK: Ah, Junior.
You're gonna break your old man's heart.
If I have to.
THOR: Nobody has to break anything.
ULTRON: Clearly you've never made an omelette.
He beat me by one second.
PIETRO: Ah, yes. He's funny.
Mr. Stark.
It's what? Comfortable?
Like old times?
This was never my life.
You two can still walk away from this.
Oh, we will.
- I know you've suffered. - (ULTRON SCOFFS)
(CHUCKLES) Captain America.
God's righteous man.
Pretending you could live without a war.
I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...
If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
I think you're confusing "peace" with "quiet."
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?
I'm glad you asked that,
because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan.
(PANTING)
- Shoot them. - Which ones?
All of them!
HENCHMAN: Move! Move! Move!
(GUNFIRE)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Oh. (YELPS)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
- Stay down, kid. - (GUNFIRE)
It's time for some mind games.
Guys? Is this a code green?
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)
Thor, status.
The girl tried to warp my mind.
- (GROANS) - Take special care.
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.
Fortunately, I am mighty.
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
ULTRON: This is going very well.
(RAPID BEEPING)
- (GRUNTS) - (GASPS)
I've done the whole mind control thing.
Not a fan.
(YELPS)
Yeah, you better run.
BARTON: Who's ever standing, we got to move!
Guys?
Again.
You'll break them.
MADAME B: Only the breakable ones.
You're made of marble.
We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
ROMANOFF: What if I fail?
(WHIMPERING)
You never fail.
- (SWING MUSIC PLAYING) - (PEOPLE LAUGHING)
(GRUNTING)
Are you ready for our dance?
(GROWLING)
(BUBBLING)
HEIMDALL: Is it him?
Is that the first son of Odin?
- Heimdall, your eyes. - Oh.
They see everything.
They see you leading us to Hel.
- Wake up! - (CHOKING)
(SWING MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)
The war is over, Steve.
We can go home.
Imagine it.
I can still save you!
We're all dead! Can you not see?
(GRUNTING)
You're a destroyer, Odinson.
(GROANING)
HEIMDALL: See where your power leads.
(SCREAMING)
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Sloppy.
(PANTING)
Pretending to fail.
The ceremony is necessary
for you to take your place in the world.
I have no place in the world.
MADAME B: Exactly.
PIETRO: What can I do?
(GROANS) It hurts.
I'm going to kill him.
- I'll be right back. - No.
(PANTING) I'm all right.
I want...
I want to finish the plan.
I want the big one.
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.
And you're not going anywhere.
Of course not. I'm already there.
You'll catch on.
But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
(GROWLING)
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER) - (BEEPING)
Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
- (PANTING) - That's not gonna happen.
Not for a while.
The whole team is down.
You got no backup here.
I'm calling in Veronica.
(POWERING UP)
(SIRENS WAILING)
(OFFICER EXCLAIMS)

(HEAVY FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

All right, everybody, stand down!
(GROWLING)
Will you listen to me?
That little witch is messing with your mind.
You're stronger than her. You're smarter than her.
- You're Bruce Banner. - (ROARING)
Right, right, right, don't mention puny Banner.
(GRUNTS)
Okay!
In the back?
Dick move, Banner.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
- (BEEPING) - Veronica, give me a hand.
(GASPS)
(ROARING)
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.
(GROWLING)
Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.
Not that way, not that way.
Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me.
- (HISSING) - (ELEVATOR BELL owes)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIM)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(YELPS)
Everybody, out!
(ROARING)
Going down?
(SPITS)
I'm sorry.
(GRUNTING)
- Damage report? - (STATIC)
That's comprehensive. Show me something.
(BEEPING)
How quickly can we buy this building?
(SCREAMING)

HILL ON RADIO: The news is loving you guys.
Nobody else is.
There's been no official call for Banner's arrest
but it's in the air.
STARK: The Stark Relief Foundation?
HILL: Already on the scene.
- How's the team? - STARK: Everyone's...
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.
HILL: Well, for now, I'd stay in stealth mode
and stay away from here.
So, run and hide?
Until we can find Ultron,
I don't have a lot else to offer.
(SIGHS) Neither do we.
(SIGHS)
Hey, you wanna switch out?
No, I'm good.
If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time
because we're still a few hours out.
Few hours from where?
A safe house.
What is this place?
Safe house.
Let's hope.
Honey?
I'm home.
Hi.
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.
Hey.
This is an agent of some kind.
Gentlemen, this is Laura.
I know all of your names. (CHUCKLES)
- (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) - Ooh. Incoming.
- Dad! - Hi, sweetheart!
Hey, buddy.
How are you guys doing?
- These are smaller agents. - BARTON: Look at your face!
Oh, my goodness.
- LILA: Did you bring Auntie Nat? - (BARTON GASPS)
- Why don't you hug her and find out? - (BARTON LAUGHING)
- Sorry for barging in on you. - Yeah, we would have called ahead,
but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Yeah, well, Fury helped me set this up when I joined.
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.
I'd like to keep it that way.
I figure it's a good place to lay low.
- LAURA: Honey. - (CRUNCHING)
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?
LAURA: She's...
Nathaniel.
Traitor.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(DINGS)
Thor?
I saw something in that dream.
I need answers. I won't find them here.
PEGGY: We can go home.
(SIGHS)
See? You worried for nothing.
Can't even feel the difference, can you?
If they're sleeping here,
some of them are gonna have to double up.
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?
How long has that been going on?
- Has what? - (LAUGHING)
You are so cute.
Nat and Banner?
I'll explain when you're older,
- Hawkeye. - Well, okay.
It's bad, right?
Nat seems really shaken.
(SIGHS)
Ultron has these allies.
These, uh, kids.
They're punks, really.
But they carry a big, damn stick.
And Nat took a serious hit.
Someone's gonna have to teach them some manners.
That someone being you.
You know I totally support your avenging.
I couldn't be prouder.
But I see those guys...
Those gods...
You don't think they need me.
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.
- They're a mess. - (SIGHING)
BARTON: Yeah.
I guess they're my mess.
You need to be sure
that this team is really a team,
and that they have your back.
Things are changing for us.
In a few months' time,
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.
I need...
Just be sure.
Yes, ma'am.
I can feel the difference.
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
Scream, and your entire staff dies.
(GASPS)
I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met.
I didn't.
Do you expect a thank-you note?
I expect you to know why.
The Cradle.
DR. CHO ON RECORDING: This is the next thing, Tony.
This is the next me.
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.
It can't build a living body.
It can. You can.
You lack the materials.
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.
But we all have room to improve.
I didn't realise you were waiting.
I would've joined you, but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.
They used up all the hot water.
I should've joined you.
Missed our window. (CHUCKLES)
Did we?
The world just saw the Hulk.
The real Hulk, for the first time.
- You know I have to leave. - You assume that I have to stay?
I had this, um, dream.
The kind that seems normal at the time,
but when you wake...
What did you dream?
That I was an Avenger.
That I was anything more
than the assassin they made me.
I think you're being hard on yourself.
Here I was hoping that was your job.
What are you doing?
I'm running with it.
With you.
If running is the plan,
as far as you want.
Are you out of your mind?
I want you to understand that, um...
Natasha,
where can I go?
Where in the world am I not a threat?
- You're not a threat to me. - Are you sure?
Even if I didn't just...
There's no future with me.
I can't ever...
I can't have this.
Kids.
Do the math. I physically can't.
Neither can I.
In the Red Room where I was trained...
Where I was raised, um,
they have a graduation ceremony.
They sterilise you.
It's efficient.
One less thing to worry about.
The one thing that might matter more than a mission.
Makes everything easier.
Even killing.
You still think you're the only monster on the team?
So, we disappear?
Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things.
I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Yeah, give him time.
We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
"Earth's mightiest heroes."
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Seems like you walked away all right.
Is that a problem?
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.
Call me old-fashioned.
Well, let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Well, I guess you'd know.
Whether you'd tell us is a bit of a question.
Banner and I were doing research.
- That would affect the team. - That would end the team!
Isn't that the mission?
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?
So we can end the fight. So we get to go home!
Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts,
innocent people die.
Every time.
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...
Clint said you wouldn't mind,
but our tractor doesn't seem to want to start at all.
- I thought maybe you might... - Yeah, I'll give her a kick.
Don't take from my pile.
(DOOR OPENS)
Hello, Deere.
Tell me everything.
What ails you?
FURY: Do me a favour.
Try not to bring it to life.
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?
Was she ever not working for you?
Artificial intelligence.
You never even hesitated.
Look, it's been a really long day,
like Eugene O'Neill long,
so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful.
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're going to shut him down.
You're not the director of me.
I'm not the director of anybody.
I'm just an old man
who cares very much about you.
And I'm the man who killed the Avengers.
I saw it.
I didn't tell the team. How could I?
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.
The whole world, too.
Because of me.
I wasn't ready.
I didn't do all I could.
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.
- Playing on your fear. - I wasn't tricked, I was shown.
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.
The end of the path I started us on.
You come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony.
War isn't one of them.
I watched my friends die.
You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right?
(SCOFFS)
Nope.
- It wasn't the worst part. - The worst part
is that you didn't.
SELVIG: I'll see you tonight.
I like the look.
If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.
I need your help.
It's nice to be needed.
It's dangerous.
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
FURY: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time.
My contacts all say he's building something.
The amount of vibranium he made off with,
I don't think it's just one thing.
What about Ultron himself?
FURY: Oh, he's easy to track. He's everywhere.
The guy is multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit.
It still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans, though.
Is he still going after launch codes?
FURY: Yes, he is.
But he's not making any headway.
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Well, I contacted our friends at the Nexus about that.
Nexus?
BANNER: It's the world Internet hub in Oslo.
Every byte of data flows through there.
Fastest access on Earth.
So, what did they say?
FURY: He's fixated on the missiles.
But the codes are constantly being changed.
By whom?
Parties unknown.
Do we have an ally?
Ultron's got an enemy. That's not the same thing.
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.
I might need to visit Oslo.
Find our unknown.
Well, this is good times, boss,
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,
you'd have more than that.
I do. I have you.
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.
Ears, everywhere else.
You kids had all the tech you could dream up.
Here we all are, back on Earth,
with nothing but our wit
and our will to save the world.
Ultron says the Avengers are the only thing
between him and his mission.
And whether or not he admits it,
his mission is global destruction.
All this, laid in a grave.
So stand.
Outwit the platinum bastard.
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
You know what, Romanoff?
So, what does he want?
To become better.
Better than us.
- He keeps building bodies. - Person bodies.
The human form is inefficient.
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.
But he keeps coming back to it.
When you two programmed him to protect the human race,
you amazingly failed.
They don't need to be protected.
They need to evolve.
Ultron's going to evolve.
How?
Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?
DR. CHO: It's beautiful.
The vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells,
they're binding them.
And S.H.I.E.L.D. never even thought to...
The most versatile substance on the planet,
and they used it to make a Frisbee.
Typical of humans.
They scratch the surface and never think
to look within.
I'll take Natasha and Clint.
All right. Strictly recon. I'll hit the Nexus.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
If Ultron's really building a body...
He'll be more powerful than any of us.
Maybe all of us.
An android designed by a robot.
You know, I really miss the days
when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
She's all yours. Apparently.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom
as soon as I get back.
Yeah, then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.
No.
It's the last project.
I promise.
SELVIG: So, this is it.
The Water of Sight.
THOR: In every realm, there's a reflection.
If the water's spirits accept me,
I can return to my dream
and find what I missed.
Men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.
STARK: A hacker who's faster than Ultron?
He could be anywhere,
and as this is the centre of everything,
I'm just a guy looking for a needle
in the world's biggest haystack.
How do you find it?
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.
(SINGING) I'm decrypting nuclear codes.
And you don't want me to.
Come and get me.
(PANTING)
Wake up!
(GROANING)
Thor!
Extinction.
(SCREAMS)
DR. CHO: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours,
but we can initiate the consciousness stream.
We're uploading your cerebral matrix
now.
(BEEPING)
I can read him.
He's dreaming.
DR. CHO: I wouldn't call it dreams.
It's Ultron's base consciousness.
Informational noise. Soon...
How soon?
I'm not being pushy.
DR. CHO: We're imprinting a physical brain.
There are no shortcuts.
Even if your magic gem...
(SCREAMS)
(WANDA PANTING)
How could you?
How could I what?
You said we would destroy the Avengers,
make a better world.
It will be better.
- When everyone is dead? - That is not...
The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
And if they don't?
Ask Noah.
You are a madman.
There were more than a dozen extinction-level events
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.
When the Earth starts to settle,
God throws a stone at it.
And, believe me, he's winding up.
We have to evolve.
There's no room
for the weak.
PIETRO: And who decides who's weak?
Life. (CHUCKLES)
Life always decides.
(AIRCRAFT APPROACHING)
There's incoming.
- The Quinjet. We have to move. - That's not a problem.
- (SIGHS IN ANNOYANCE) - (DR. CHO GROANS)
(STAMMERS) Wait, guys!
(BOTH GROANING)
They'll understand.
When they see, they'll understand.
I just need a little more time.
Two minutes. Stay close.
Dr. Cho!
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
He's uploading himself into the body.
Where?
The real power is inside the Cradle.
The gem,
its power is uncontainable.
You can't just blow it up.
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
First, I have to find it.
Go.
ROGERS: Did you guys copy that?
We did.
I got a private jet taking off across town.
No manifest.
That could be him.
There. It's a truck from the lab.
Right above you, Cap.
On the loop by the bridge.
It's them.
You got three with the Cradle, one in the cab.
I could take out the driver.
ROGERS: Negative. That truck crashes,
the gem could level the city.
We need to draw out Ultron.
(PANTING)
(GRUNTS)
No, no, no, no.
Leave me alone!
(GROANS)
Well, he's definitely unhappy.
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
You're not a match for him, Cap.
(PANTING)
Thanks, Barton.
(GASPS)
(PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY)
You know what's in that cradle?
The power to make real change.
And that terrifies you.
I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Stop it.
We got a window. Four, three...
Give him hell.
I'm always picking up after you boys.
They're heading under the overpass. I've got no shot.
ROMANOFF: Which way?
Hard right.
Now.
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
(TYRES SQUEALING)
(GRUNTING)
(ENGINE REVVING)
Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through!
Come on!
ROMANOFF: Clint, can you draw out the guards?
Let's find out.
ROMANOFF: Beep, beep!
(SPEAKING KOREAN)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
They're heading back towards you.
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.
ROMANOFF: I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?
(PANTING) What do you think I've been doing?
(YELPING)
(STRAINING)
BARTON: Okay, package is airborne.
I have a clean shot.
Negative. I am still in the truck.
- What the hell are you... - Just be ready.
I'm sending the package to you.
How do you want me to take it?
Uh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.
Please, don't do this.
What choice do we have?
I lost him!
He's headed your way!
(ALARM BLARING)
Nat, we gotta go.
- (GROANS) - Nat!
Cap, you see Nat?
If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!
Do you have eyes on Nat?
Go!
Damn it.
Civilians in our path.
Can you stop this thing?
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GRUNTS)
(PANTING)
I'm fine.
I just need to take a minute.
I'm very tempted not to give you one.
The Cradle. Did you get it?
Stark will take care of it.
No, he won't.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Stark's not crazy.
He will do anything to make things right.
Stark, come in.
Stark.
Anyone on comms.
Ultron can't tell the difference
between saving the world and destroying it.
Where do you think he gets that?
- Anything on Nat? - I haven't heard.
But she's alive, or Ultron would be rubbing our faces in it.
This is sealed tight.
We're gonna need to access the program,
break it down from within.
Any chance Natasha might leave you
a message outside the Internet?
Old-school spy stuff?
BARTON: There are some nets I can cast.
Yeah, I'll find her.
I can work on tissue degeneration
if you could fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.
Yeah, about that.
No.
- You have to trust me. - Kind of don't.
Our ally, the guy protecting the military's nuclear codes,
I found him.
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.
STARK: Ultron didn't go after Jarvis because he was angry.
He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do.
So Jarvis went underground.
Scattered, dumped his memory.
But not his protocols.
He didn't even know he was in there until I pieced him together.
(BANNER SCOFFS)
So, you want me to help you put Jarvis into this thing?
No! Of course not.
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.
We're out of my field, here.
You know bio-organics better than anyone.
And you just assume that Jarvis's operational matrix
can beat Ultron's?
Jarvis has been beating him from inside without knowing it.
This is the opportunity.
We can create Ultron's perfect self
without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality.
- We have to. - I believe it's worth a go.
I'm in a loop!
I'm caught in a time loop. This is exactly where it all went wrong.
I know. I know. I know what everyone's gonna say.
But they're already saying it.
We're mad scientists.
We're monsters, buddy. We've gotta own it.
Make a stand.
It's not a loop.
It's the end of the line.
I wasn't sure you would wake up.
I hoped you would. I wanted to show you.
I don't have anyone else.
(GROANING)
I think a lot about meteors. The purity in them.
Boom! The end.
Start again.
The world made clean
for the new man to rebuild.
I was meant to be new.
I was meant to be beautiful.
The world would have looked to the sky
and seen hope,
seen mercy.
Instead, they'll look up in horror
because of you.
You've wounded me.
I give you full marks for that.
But, like the man said, what doesn't kill me...
(GASPS)
just makes me stronger.
(PANTING)
(STATIC)
(TYPING)
This framework is not compatible.
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.
You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.
- I'm gonna say this once. - How about "none-ce"?
- ROGERS: Shut it down! - Nope, not gonna happen.
You don't know what you're doing.
And you do?
She's not in your head?
I know you're angry.
Oh, we're way past that.
I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.
Banner, after everything that's happened...
It's nothing compared to what's coming!
- WANDA: You don't know what's in there. - ROGERS: This isn't a game!
- No, no. Go on. - (POWERING DOWN)
- You were saying? - (GUNSHOT)
- Pietro! - (GRUNTS)
BARTON: What?
You didn't see that coming?
I'm rerouting the upload.
- (GASPS) - Go ahead, piss me off.
(GUN COCKS)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GROANS)
Wait!
(GRUNTING)
I am sorry. That was
odd.
Thank you.
(SIGHS)
ROGERS: Thor.
- You helped create this? - THOR: I've had a vision.
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life, and at its centre is that.
What? The gem?
It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones.
The greatest power in the universe,
unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
- Then why would you bring... - Because Stark is right.
Oh, it's definitely the end times.
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Not alone.
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix
to create something new.
ROGERS: I think I've had my fill of new.
You think I'm a child of Ultron.
ROGERS: You're not?
I'm not Ultron.
I am not Jarvis. I am...
I am.
WANDA: I looked in your head
and saw annihilation.
- Look again. - (BARTON SCOFFS)
Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,
Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone.
And they're nothing compared to what it can unleash.
- But with it on our side... - ROGERS: Is it?
Are you?
On our side?
I don't think it's that simple.
BARTON: Well, it better get real simple real soon.
I am on the side of life.
Ultron isn't.
He will end it all.
STARK: What's he waiting for?
- You. - BANNER: Where?
BARTON: Sokovia.
He's got Nat there, too.
If we're wrong about you,
if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...
What will you do?
I don't want to kill Ultron.
He's unique and he's in pain.
But that pain will roll over the Earth.
So, he must be destroyed.
Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net.
We have to act now.
And not one of us can do it without the others.
Maybe I am a monster.
I don't think I'd know if I were one.
I'm not what you are,
and not what you intended.
So, there may be no way to make you trust me.
But we need to go.
Right.
Well done.
Three minutes.
Get what you need.
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.
STARK: No way we all get through this.
If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost.
There's gonna be blood on the floor.
I got no plans tomorrow night.
STARK: I get first crack at the big guy.
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
That's true. He hates you the most.
ROGERS: Ultron knows we're coming.
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.
And that's what we signed up for.
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.
So our priority
is getting them out.
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(ALL GASP)
Get off your asses.
ROGERS: All they want is to live their lives in peace.
And that's not gonna happen today.
But we can do our best to protect them.
And we can get the job done.
We find out what Ultron's been building,
we find Romanoff,
and we clear the field.
Keep the fight between us.
Ultron thinks we're monsters.
That we're what's wrong with the world.
This isn't just about beating him.
It's about whether he's right.
BANNER: Natasha!
Natasha!
Bruce?
You all right?
Yeah.
The team is in the city. It's about to light up.
I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.
Yeah. I did.
(WEAPON POWERING UP)
So what's our play?
I'm here to get you to safety.
- Job's not finished. - We could help with the evacuation,
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.
And you've done plenty.
Our fight is over.
So, we just disappear?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
- (CAR HORNS HONKING) - Come on.
FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss.
I think he's waiting for you.
ULTRON: Come to confess your sins?
I don't know. How much time you got?
ULTRON: More than you.
Uh...
Have you been juicing? Little vibranium cocktail?
You're looking... I don't wanna say "puffy."
You're stalling to protect the people.
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.
What?
You think you were the only one stalling?
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the vibranium.
Function, still unclear.
ULTRON: This is how you end, Tony.
This is peace in my time.
(MAN GASPS)
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Go!
WANDA: Get off the bridge!
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Run!
(GROANS)
VISION: Ultron.
My Vision.
They really did take everything from me.
You set the terms. You can change them.
All right.
(GASPING)
(VISION GRUNTING)
(CRACKS NECK)
Friday, the Vision?
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net.
He won't escape through there.
(GROANING)
ULTRON: You shut me out.
You think I care?
You take away my world,
I take away yours.
(POWERING UP)

(SCREAMING)
(SHOUTING)
(GROANING)
Friday.
FRIDAY: Sokovia is going for a ride.
(YELPING)
ULTRON: Do you see
the beauty of it?
The inevitability.
You rise, only to fall.
You, Avengers, you are my meteor.
My swift and terrible sword.
And the earth will crack
with the weight of your failure.
Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me.
It means nothing.
When the dust settles,
the only thing living in this world
will be metal.
We gotta move.
You're not gonna turn green?
I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
I adore you.
But I need the other guy.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTS)
Let's finish the job.
(ROMANOFF SCREAMING)
(GROANS)
(PANTING)
I really hope this makes us even.
(GRUNTS)
- Now go be a hero. - (ROARING)
FRIDAY: The vibranium core's got a magnetic field.
That's what's keeping the rock together.
If it drops?
Right now, the impact will kill thousands.
Once it gets high enough? Global extinction.
That building's not clear. The 10th floor.
(ALL WHIMPERING)
Hi.
Okay. Get in the tub!
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.
(GRUNTS)
Cap, you got incoming.
Incoming already came in.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely.
The rest of us have one job,
tear these things apart.
You get hurt, hurt them back.
You get killed,
walk it off.

(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)
- (ROARING) - (PEOPLE SCREAMING)
Go, go, go!
WANDA: How could I let this happen?
- Hey, hey, you okay? - This is all our fault.
Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.
Who cares?
Are you up for this?
Are you?
Look, I just need to know.
Because the city is flying.
Okay. Look, the city is flying,
we're fighting an army of robots,
and I have a bow and arrow.
None of this makes sense.
(BARTON GRUNTING)
But I'm going back out there because it's my job.
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.
It doesn't matter what you did or what you were.
If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill.
Stay in here, you're good. I'll send your brother to come find you.
But if you step out that door,
you are an Avenger.
All right. Good chat.
Yeah, the city is flying.

You'll never...
"Never" what? You didn't finish!
What, were you napping?
(RETCHING)
(GRUNTING)
Thor.
You're bothering me.
Ow!
(BARTON GROANING)
(SIGHS)
All right, we're all clear here.
ROGERS: We are not clear!
We are very not clear!
(GRUNTING)
All right, coming to you.
- PIETRO: Keep up, old man! - (GASPS)
Nobody would know.
Nobody.
"The last I saw him, an Ultron was sitting on him."
"Yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard."
"I miss him already."
Hold your fire!
Romanoff!
Thanks!
(BEEPING)
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.
Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.
The city's not coming down slow.
Spire is vibranium.
If I get Thor to hit it...
It will crack. That's not enough.
The impact would still be devastating.
STARK: Maybe if we can cap the other end.
Keep the atomic action doubling back.
FRIDAY: That could vaporise the city.
And everyone on it.
(PANTING)
ROGERS: The next wave is gonna hit any minute.
- What do you got, Stark? - STARK: Huh? Nothing great.
Maybe a way to blow up the city.
That'll keep it from impacting the surface,
if you guys can get clear.
I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.
STARK: Impact radius is getting bigger every second.
We're gonna have to make a choice.
ROMANOFF: Cap, these people are going nowhere.
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock... - Not till everyone's safe.
Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
I didn't say we should leave.
There's worse ways to go.
Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
FURY ON RADIO: Glad you like the view, Romanoff.
It's about to get better.
(PANTING)
FURY: Nice, right?
Pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends.
She's dusty, but she'll do.
Fury, you son of a bitch.
Ooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.
Lifeboats secure to deploy.
Disengage in three, two...
Take them out.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D. is supposed to be.
(CHUCKLES)
This is not so bad.
Let's load them up.
Sir, we have multiple bogies
converging on our starboard flank.
Show 'em what we got.
You're up.
Yes!
Now this is gonna be a good story.
STARK: Yup. If you live to tell it.
RHODES: (SCOFFS) You think I can't hold my own?
We get through this, I'll hold your own.
RHODES: You had to make it weird.
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
I got about 50 to 100 more coming in after this group.
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
MALE OFFICER: Let's go, everyone!
Number six boat is topped and locked...
(STAMMERS) Or stocked... Topped...
It's full of people.
(ALARM BLARING)
Incoming!
Oh, God!
(GRUNTING)
ULTRON: You think you're saving anyone?
I turn that key and drop this rock a little early
and it's still billions dead.
Even you can't stop that.
I am Thor, son of Odin,
and as long as there is life in my breast...
I am running out of things to say! Are you ready?
VISION: It's terribly well-balanced.
Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so...
STARK: I got it. Create a heat seal.
I could...
I could supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY: Running numbers.
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
FRIDAY: A heat seal could work with enough power.
- STARK: Thor, I got a plan. - THOR: We're out of time.
They're coming for the core.
Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
- On it. - Avengers, time to work for a living.
- Are you good? - Yeah.
Romanoff.
You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."
ROMANOFF: Relax, shellhead.
Not all of us can fly.
(PANTING)
- What's the drill? - This is the drill.
If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.
Is that the best you can do?
You had to ask.
This is the best I can do.
This is exactly what I wanted.
All of you
against all of me.
How can you possibly hope to stop me?
Well, like the old man said...
Together.
(ROARING)
(STRAINING)
(SPITS)
(GROANING)
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...
(GROWLS)
They'll try to leave the city.
We can't let them, not even one. Rhodey.
RHODES: I'm on it.
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.
War Machine coming at you! Right...
Okay, what?
We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin.
You guys get to the boats.
I'll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you.
- What about the core? - I'll protect it.
It's my job.
Nat.
This way.
(PANTING)
Get the people on the boats.
I'm not going to leave you here.
I can handle this.
Come back for me when everyone else is off.
- Not before. - (GRUNTS IN ANNOYANCE)
You understand?
You know, I'm 12 minutes older than you.
(CHUCKLES) Go.
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below...
Reroute everything. We get one shot at this.
BARTON: I know what I need to do.
The dining room.
If I knock out that east wall,
it'd make a nice workspace for Laura, huh?
Put up some baffling.
She can't hear the kids running around. What do you think?
You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
BARTON: No one eats in a dining room.
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
(ROARING)
We don't have a lot of time.
So get your ass on a boat.
(PANTING)
Hey, big guy.
Sun's getting real low.
ROGERS: You're safe now. You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.
Secure your gear, find a seat.
ZRINKA: Costel!
We were in the market.
Costel!
STARK: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
- Is this the last of them? - Yeah.
- Everyone else is on the carrier. - STARK: You know, this works,
we maybe don't walk away.
Maybe not.
(GRUNTING)
(ROMANOFF GROANS)
(ROARING)
(SINGING) I got no strings, so I have fun.
I'm not tied up to anyone.
Come on. Time to go.

No, no, I'm fine.
Fine.

It felt like that.

Now!
(YELLING)
ROMANOFF: Hey, big guy. We did it.
The job is finished.
Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode.
So help me out. I need you...
You're afraid.
Of you?
Of death.
You're the last one.
You were supposed to be the last.
Stark asked for a saviour
and settled for a slave.
I suppose we are both disappointments.
(ULTRON LAUGHING)
I suppose we are.
Humans are odd.
They think order and chaos are somehow opposites
and try to control what won't be.
But there is grace in their failings.
I think you missed that.
They're doomed.
Yes.
But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts.
It's a privilege to be among them.
You're unbearably naive.
Well...

- LAURA: Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat! - (GURGLING)
Fat.
FURY: One of our tech boys flagged this.
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.
Could be the Quinjet.
But with Stark's stealth tech,
we still can't track the damn thing.
Right.
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.
He'll send a postcard.
"Wish you were here."
You sent me to recruit him way back when.
Did you know then what was gonna happen?
You never know.
You hope for the best, then make do with what you get.
I got a great team.
Nothing lasts forever.
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.
No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.
ROGERS: The rules have changed.
STARK: We're dealing with something new.
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.
- A machine. - So, it doesn't count?
No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Right, different rules for us.
- Nice guy. Artificial. - ROGERS: Thank you.
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.
It's safe with the Vision.
And these days, safe is in short supply.
But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
- It would still go up. - Elevator's not worthy.
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.
Not if you don't leave.
I have no choice.
The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones
to show up in the last few years.
It's not a coincidence.
Someone has been playing an intricate game
and has made pawns of us.
And once all these pieces are in position...
Triple Yahtzee.
You think you can find out what's coming?
I do.
Besides this one,
there's nothing that can't be explained.
That man has no regard for lawn maintenance.
I'm gonna miss him, though. And you're gonna miss me.
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
- (CAR LOCK BEEPS) - (ENGINE STARTS)
I will miss you, Tony.
Yeah?
Well, it's time for me to tap out.
Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book.
Build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
The simple life.
- You'll get there one day. - I don't know.
Family, stability...
The guy who wanted all that went in the ice 75 years ago.
I think someone else came out.
You all right?
(SOLDIERS SHOUTING IN DISTANCE)
I'm home.
You wanna keep staring at the wall, or do you wanna go to work?
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes.
How do we look?
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
We got some hitters.
They're good. They're not a team.
Let's beat them into shape.
Avengers...
THANOS: Fine.
I'll do it myself.

Peter.
Your momma wants to speak with you.
Come on, Pete. Take these fool things off.
Why have you been fighting with the other boys again, baby?
Peter?
They killed a little frog that ain't done nothing.
Smushed it with a stick.
You're so like your daddy.
You even look like him.
And he was an angel.
- Composed out of pure light. - Mer?
You got a present there for Peter, don't you?
Of course.
There.
I've got you covered, Pete.
You open it up when I'm gone, okay?
Your grandpa
is gonna take such good care of you.
At least until your daddy comes back to get you.
Take my hand.
Peter.
Pete, come on.
Take my hand.
Mom?
No! No! No! No!
Mom! No!
- Come with me. - No!
No!
You've got to stay here. Please.
No...
Okay?
No.
Mom!
Drop it!
Hey.
- Drop it, now! - Hey, cool, man. No problem.
No problem at all.
How do you know about this?
I don't even know what that is.
I'm just a junker, man. I was just checking stuff out.
You don't look like a junker. You're wearing Ravager garb.
This is just an outfit, man.
- Ninja Turtle, you better stop poking me. - What is your name?
My name is Peter Quill, okay? Dude, chill out.
- Move! - Why?
Ronan may have questions for you.
Hey, you know what? There's another name you might know me by.
Star-Lord.
- Who? - Star-Lord, man. Legendary outlaw.
- Guys? - Move!
Forget this.
Peter?
What happened?
Hey...
I...
- Bereet. - Bereet!
Look, I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I forgot you're here.
Scattered riots broke out across the Kree Empire today
protesting the recent peace treaty signed by the Kree Emperor
and Xandar's Nova Prime.
Peter, you have call.
- No, wait, don't! - Quill?
Hey, Yondu.
I'm here on Morag.
Ain't no Orb, ain't no you.
Well, I was in the neighborhood. I thought I'd save you the hassle.
Well, where are you at now, boy?
I feel really bad about this, but I'm not gonna tell you that.
- I slaved putting this deal together. - Slaved?
Making a few calls is "slaved"? I mean, really?
And now you're gonna rip me off!
We do not do that to each other. We're Ravagers. We got a code.
Yeah, and that code is "steal from everybody."
- When I picked you up on Terra... - "Picked me up."
- ...these boys of mine wanted to eat you. - Yeah?
They ain't never tasted any Terran before.
I stopped them. You're alive because of me!
I will find you, I will...
Put a bounty on him! Forty K.
- But I want him back alive. - Yeah, Cap.
- Alive? - That's what I said.
I told you when you picked that kid up, you should have delivered him
like we was hired to do! He was cargo!
- You have always been soft on him. - You're the only one I'm being soft on!
Now, don't you worry about Mr. Quill.
As soon as we get him back here,
I'm gonna kill him myself.
What we do need to worry about,
is who else out there wants that Orb!
They call me "terrorist,"
"radical," "zealot,"
because I obey the ancient laws of my people, the Kree,
and punish those who do not.
Because I do not forgive your people
for taking the life of my father,
and his father, and his father before him.
A thousand years of war between us will not be forgotten!
You can't do this! Our government signed a peace treaty.
My government knows no shame.
You Xandarians and your culture are a disease.
You
will never rule Xandar.
No.
I will cure it!
Ronan,
Korath has returned.
Master, he is a thief,
an outlaw who calls himself Star-Lord.
But we have discovered he has an agreement
to retrieve the Orb for an intermediary known
as The Broker.
I promised Thanos I would retrieve the Orb for him.
Only then will he destroy Xandar for me.
Nebula, go to Xandar and get me the Orb.
It will be my honor.
It will be your doom.
If this happens again, you'll be facing our father
without his prize.
I'm a daughter of Thanos.
Just like you.
But I know Xandar.
Ronan has already decreed that I...
Do not speak for me.
You will not fail.
Have I ever?
Xandarians.
What a bunch of losers.
All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid,
to nothing at all. Pathetic.
Look at this guy!
Can you believe they call us criminals,
when he's assaulting us with that haircut?
What is this thing? Look how it thinks it's so cool.
It's not cool to get help! Walk by yourself, you little gargoyle.
Look at Mr. Smiles over here.
Where's your wife, old man? What a class-A prevert.
Right, Groot?
Groot?
Don't drink fountain water, you idiot.
That's disgusting!
Yes, you did. I just saw you doing it.
Why are you lying?
Looks like we got one.
Okay, humie, how bad does someone wanna find you?
40,000 units? Groot, we're gonna be rich.
- Mr. Quill. - Broker.
The Orb.
- As commissioned. - Where's Yondu?
Wanted to be here. Sends his love.
And told me to tell you,
that you got the best eyebrows in the business.
What is it?
It's my policy never to discuss my clients, or their needs.
Yeah, well, I almost died getting it for you.
An occupational hazard, I'm sure, in your line of work.
Some machine-headed freak, working for a dude named Ronan.
Ronan? I'm sorry, Mr. Quill.
I truly am.
But I want no part of this transaction if Ronan is involved.
Who's Ronan?
A Kree fanatic, outraged by the peace treaty,
who will not rest until Xandarian culture, my culture,
- is wiped from existence! - Come on.
He's someone whose bad side I'd rather not be on.
- What? What about my bad side? - Farewell, Mr. Quill.
Hey, we had a deal, bro!
What happened?
This guy just backed out of a deal on me. If there's one thing I hate,
it's a man without integrity. Peter Quill. People call me Star-Lord.
You have the bearing of a man of honor.
Well, you know, I wouldn't say that.
People say it about me, all the time,
but it's not something I would ever say about myself.
This wasn't the plan.
Put him in the bag. Put him in the bag!
No! Not her, him!
Learn genders, man.
Biting? That's not fair!
Take it easy!
Fool. You should have learned.
I don't learn. One of my issues.
What the...
Quit smiling, you idiot. You're supposed to be a professional.
You gotta be kidding me.
Hey!
I live for the simple things.
Like how much this is gonna hurt.
Yeah. Writhe, little man.
It'll grow back, you d'ast idiot.
Quit whining.
Subject 89P13, drop your weapon.
Crap.
By the authority of the Nova Corps,
- you are under arrest... - All right. Come on up.
...for endangerment to life and the destruction of property.
Hey! If it isn't Star-Prince.
- Star-Lord. - Sorry. "Lord."
I picked this guy up a while back for petty theft. He's got a code name.
Yeah. Stay out of the way.
Come on, man. It's a... It's an outlaw name.
Just relax, pal.
It's cool to have a code name. It's not that weird.
Fascists.
Ronan is destroying Xandarian outposts throughout the galaxy.
I should think that would call for some slight response on the part of the Kree.
We signed your peace treaty, Nova Prime. What more do you want?
At least a statement from the Kree Empire saying that they condemn his actions.
He is slaughtering children. Families.
That is your business. Now, I have other matters to attend to.
Prick.
Well, some good news.
It looks like we've apprehended one of Ronan's compatriots.
Gamora. Surgically modified and trained as a living weapon.
The adopted daughter of the Mad Titan, Thanos.
Recently, Thanos lent her and her sister Nebula out to Ronan,
which leads us to believe that Thanos and Ronan are working together.
Subject 89P13. Calls itself "Rocket."
The result of illegal genetic
and cybernetic experiments on a lower life form.
What the hell?
They call it "Groot."
A humanoid plant that's been travelling recently
as 89P13's personal houseplantlmuscle.
Peter Jason Quill, from Terra.
Raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the Ravagers,
led by Yondu Udonta.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know how this machine worked.
What a bunch of a-holes.
Transport all four to the Kyln.
I guess most of Nova Corps wanna uphold the laws,
but these ones here, they're corrupt and cruel.
But, hey, that's not my problem. I ain't gonna be here long.
I've escaped 22 prisons. This one's no different.
You're lucky the broad showed up, because otherwise, me and Groot
would be collecting that bounty right now,
and you'd be getting drawn and quartered by Yondu and those Ravagers.
I've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years.
I ain't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon.
Hold.
- What's a raccoon? - "What's a raccoon?"
It's what you are, stupid.
Ain't no thing like me, except me.
So, this Orb has a real shiny blue suitcase,
Ark of the Covenant, Maltese Falcon sort of vibe.
- What is it? - I am Groot.
So what? What's the Orb?
I have no words for an honorless thief.
Pretty high and mighty coming from the lackey of a genocidal maniac.
Yeah, I know who you are.
- Anyone who's anyone knows who you are. - Yeah, we know who you are.
- Who is she? - I am Groot.
Yeah, you said that.
I wasn't retrieving the Orb for Ronan. I was betraying him.
I had an agreement to sell it to a third party.
I am Groot.
Well, that's just as fascinating as the first 89 times you told me that.
What is wrong with Giving Tree, here?
Well, he don't know talking good like me and you.
So his vocabulistics is limited to "I" and "am" and "Groot."
Exclusively in that order.
I tell you what, that's gonna wear real thin, real fast.
Hey. Put that away.
Hey!
Listen to me, you big blue bastard. Take those headphones off.
That's mine. Those belong to impound. That tape and that player is mine!
Hooked on a Feeling, Blue Swede, 1973. That song belongs to me!
- You first! You first! - Murderer!
Coming for you first, Gamora! You're dead!
You're scum! You're scum!
It's like I said,
she's got a rep.
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families
to Ronan and his goons.
She'll last a day, tops.
Murderer!
The guards will protect her, right?
They're here to stop us from getting out.
They don't care what we do to each other inside.
Whatever nightmares the future holds,
are dreams compared to what's behind me.
Check out the new meat.
I'm gonna slather you up in Gunavian jelly,
and go to town...
Let's make something clear.
This one here is our booty!
You wanna get to him,
you go through us!
Or, more accurately,
we go through you.
I'm with them.
I hate you.
No cell's gonna protect you for long.
You're dead!
Dead!
Take her down to the showers.
It'll be easier to clean up the blood down there.
Quill, where you going?
Quill.
Quill!
Gamora, consider this a death sentence
for your crimes against the galaxy.
You dare?
You know who I am, yes?
You're Drax.
The Destroyer.
Quill!
And you know why they call me this.
You slayed dozens of Ronan's minions.
Ronan murdered my wife, Ovette,
and my daughter, Camaria.
He slaughtered them where they stood.
And he laughed!
Quill?
Her life
is not yours to take.
He killed my family.
I shall kill one of his in return.
Of course, Drax. Here, I...
Quill! What are you doing?
I'm no family to Ronan or Thanos.
I'm your only hope at stopping him.
Woman, your words mean nothing to me!
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! - Crap.
You know, if killing Ronan is truly your sole purpose,
I don't think this is the best way to go about it.
Are you not the man this wench attempted to kill?
Well, I mean, she's hardly the first woman to try and do that to me.
Look, this is from a smoking-hot Rajak girl.
Stabbed me with a fork. Didn't like me skipping out on her at sunrise.
I got, right here, a Kree girl tried to rip out my thorax.
She caught me with this skinny little A'askavariian who worked in Nova Records.
I was trying to get information. You ever see an A'askavariian?
They have tentacles, and needles for teeth.
If you think I'm seriously interested in that, then...
You don't care. But here's the point.
She betrayed Ronan. He's coming back for her.
And when he does,
that's when you...
Why would I put my finger on his throat?
What?
No, it's a symbol.
This is a symbol for you slicing his throat.
I would not slice his throat.
I would cut his head clean off.
It's a general expression for you killing somebody.
You've heard of this. You've seen this, right?
- You know what that is. - Yeah. Yeah.
- Everyone knows. - No, no.
What I'm saying is, you want to keep her alive.
Don't do his work for him.
I like your knife. I'm keeping it.
- That was my favorite knife. - Listen!
I could care less whether you live or whether you die.
- Then why stop the big guy? - Simple.
You know where to sell my Orb.
How are we gonna sell it when we and it are still here?
My friend Rocket, here,
has escaped 22 prisons.
We're getting out.
And then we're headed straight to Yondu to retrieve your bounty.
How much was your buyer willing to pay you for my Orb?
Four billion units.
- What? - Holy shit.
That Orb is my opportunity to get away from Thanos and Ronan.
If you free us,
I'll lead you to the buyer directly and I'll split the profit between the three of us.
I am Groot.
Four of us.
Asleep for the danger, awake for the money, as per frickin' usual.
You have been betrayed, Ronan.
We know only that she has been captured.
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.
No! Our sources within the Kyln say Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.
Look, your partnership with Thanos
is at risk.
Thanos requires your presence. Now!
With all due respect, Thanos, your daughter made this mess,
and yet you summon me.
I would lower my voice, Accuser.
First, she lost a battle with some primitive.
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.
Then she was apprehended by the Nova Corps.
You are the one here with nothing to show for it.
Your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time!
Lower your tone!
I may be your...
I only ask that you take this matter seriously.
The only matter I do not take seriously, boy,
is you.
Your politics bore me.
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.
And, apparently, you alienated my favorite daughter, Gamora.
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,
if you bring me the Orb.
But return to me again empty-handed,
and I will bathe the starways in your blood.
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.
This is one fight you won't win.
Let's head to the Kyln.
If we're gonna get out of here, we're gonna need to get into that watchtower.
And to do that, I'm gonna need a few things.
The guards wear security bands to control their ins and outs. I need one.
Leave it to me.
That dude, there. I need his prosthetic leg.
- His leg? - Yeah.
God knows I don't need the rest of him. Look at him, he's useless.
All right.
And finally, on the wall back there is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.
- Do you see it? - Yeah.
There's a quarnyx battery behind it. Purplish box, green wires.
To get into that watchtower, I definitely need it.
How are we supposed to do that?
Well, supposably, these bald-bodies find you attractive.
So, maybe you can work out some sort of trade.
You must be joking.
No, I really heard they find you attractive.
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,
and it's in the middle of the most heavily-guarded part of the prison.
It's impossible to get up there without being seen.
I got one plan, and that plan requires a frickin' quarnyx battery,
so figure it out!
Can I get back to it? Thanks.
Now, this is important. Once the battery is removed,
everything is gonna slam into emergency mode.
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly, so you definitely need to get that last.
Or we could just get it first and improvise.
- I'll get the armband. - Leg.
Prisoner, drop the device immediately and retreat to your cell,
or we will open fire.
I am
Groot!
Fire!
All prisoners return to your sleeping areas.
You idiot!
How am I supposed to fight these things without my stuff?
The animal is in control.
Fire on my command!
Creepy little beast!
Oh, yeah.
You need my what?
- I'll need this. - Good luck.
It's internally wired.
I'll figure something out.
Drop the leg!
Drop the leg and move back to your cell!
Rocket!
Move to the watchtower!
You!
Man who has lain with an A'askavariian!
It was one time, man.
We need all available guards in full combat gear...
Spare me your foul gaze, woman.
Why is this one here?
We promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss.
I always keep my promises, when they're to muscle-bound whack-jobs
who will kill me if I don't. Here you go.
I was just kidding about the leg. I just need these two things.
- What? - No, I thought it'd be funny.
Was it funny? Wait, what did he look like hopping around?
I had to transfer him 30,000 units!
How are we going to leave?
Well, he's got a plan. Right? Or is that another thing you made up?
I have a plan! I have a plan!
Cease your yammering and relieve us from this irksome confinement.
Yeah, I'll have to agree with the walking thesaurus on that one.
Do not ever call me a thesaurus.
It's just a metaphor, dude.
His people are completely literal. Metaphors are gonna go over his head.
Nothing goes over my head.
My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it.
I'm gonna die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.
Those are some big guns.
On my command!
Number one!
- Rodent, we are ready for your plan. - Hold on!
Number two!
I recognize this animal. We'd roast them over a flame pit as children.
- Their flesh was quite delicious. - Not helping!
Number three!
All fire on my command!
Three!
Two!
One!
He turned off the artificial gravity,
everywhere but in here.
I told you I had a plan.
That was a pretty good plan.
Yeah! There it is. Get my ship.
It's the Milano, the orange and blue one over in the corner.
They crumpled my pants up into a ball.
That's rude! They folded yours.
The Orb's there. Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait. - What?
That bastard didn't put it back.
- Put what back? - Here.
Get them to the ship. I will be right back.
- How are you gonna possibly... - Just keep the Milano close by.
Go.
Go!
My neck!
Well, how's he gonna get to us?
He declined to share that information with me.
Well, screw this, then!
I ain't waiting around for some humie with a death wish. You got the Orb, right?
Yes.
If we don't leave now, we will be blown to bits.
No!
We're not leaving without the Orb.
Behold.
This one shows spirit.
He shall make a keen ally in the battle against Ronan.
Companion, what were you retrieving?
You're an imbecile.
Yo, Ranger Rick! What are you doing?
You can't take apart my ship without asking me!
- See, what is this? - Don't touch that!
It's a bomb.
- A bomb? - Yup.
And you leave it lying around?
I was gonna put it in a box.
What's a box gonna do?
- How about this one? - No! Hey!
- Leave it alone. - Why? What is it?
- Shut up. - Hey!
What is that?
That's for if things get really hardcore.
Or if you wanna blow up moons.
No one's blowing up moons.
You just wanna suck the joy out of everything.
So, listen, I'm gonna need your buyer's coordinates.
We're heading in the right direction. For now.
If we're gonna work together, you might try trusting me a little bit.
And how much do you trust me?
I'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was.
Because I'm guessing it's some kind of weapon.
I don't know what it is.
If it's a weapon, we should use it against Ronan.
Put it down, you fool. You'll destroy us all.
Or just you, murderess!
I let you live once, princess!
- I am not a princess! - Hey!
Nobody is killing anybody on my ship!
We're stuck together until we get the money.
I have no interest in money.
Great.
That means more money for the three of us.
For the four of us. Partners.
We have an agreement, but I would never be partners with the likes of you.
I'll tell the buyer we're on our way.
And Quill, your ship is filthy.
She has no idea.
If I had a black light,
the place would look like a Jackson Pollock painting.
You got issues, Quill.
I swear. I don't know where they went! I swear.
If he knew where they were headed, he would have already told us.
Yeah.
Ronan, the Nova Corps sent a fleet to defend the prison.
Well, then, send Necrocraft to every corner of the quadrant.
Find the Orb. Any means, any price.
- And this place? - The Nova can't know what we're after.
Cleanse it!
Do you got any other cute little buggers like this one?
I like to stick 'em all in a row on my control console.
I can't tell if you're joking or not.
He's being fully serious.
In that case, I can show you...
But first, you gonna tell me what this Orb is,
and why everybody cares so damn much about it.
And then you gonna tell me,
who out there might wanna buy it.
Sir, the high-end community is a...
The high-end community is a...
It's a tight-knit...
Tight-knit...
The high-end community is a very tight-knit...
I cannot possibly betray
the confidentiality of my buyers!
Now, who again is this buyer of yours?
Carina.
Yes, Master.
Your people do have elbows, do they not?
We do, Master.
Then use them.
I don't have to remind you
what happened to the last attendant who disappointed me.
Do I?
Chop, chop. Our guests will be here soon.
Heads up! We're inbound.
What is it?
It's called Knowhere.
The severed head of an ancient celestial being.
Be wary headed in, rodent.
There are no regulations whatsoever here.
Hundreds of years ago, the Tivan Group sent workers in
to mine the organic matter within the skull.
Bone, brain tissue, spinal fluid.
All rare resources, highly valued in black markets across the galaxy.
It's dangerous and illegal work, suitable only for outlaws.
Well, I come from a planet of outlaws.
Billy the Kid, Bonnie and Clyde, John Stamos.
It sounds like a place, which I would like to visit.
Yeah, you should.
Excuse me.
- Watch your wallets. - Can you spare any units?
Get out of here.
Your buyer's in there?
We are to wait here for his representative.
Get out of here!
This is no respectable establishment.
What do you expect us to do while we wait?
Yes! Yes!
Yahoo!
My Orloni has won,
as I won at all things!
Now, let's put more of this liquid into our bodies.
That's the first thing you said that wasn't bat-shit crazy!
Man, you wouldn't believe what they charge for fuel out here.
- I might actually lose money on this job. - My connection is making us wait.
It's just a negotiation tactic. Trust me, this is my specialty.
Where yours is more, "Stab, stab. Those are my terms."
- My father didn't stress diplomacy. - Thanos?
He's not my father.
When Thanos took my home world, he killed my parents in front of me.
He tortured me, turned me into a weapon.
When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ronan,
I couldn't stand by and...
Why would you risk your life for this?
My mother gave it to me.
My mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up.
I happened to have it on me,
when I was...
The day that she...
You know, when I left Earth.
What do you do with it?
Do? Nothing. You listen to it. Or you can dance.
I'm a warrior and an assassin. I do not dance.
Really?
On my planet, there's a legend about people like you.
It's called
Footloose.
And in it, a great hero
named Kevin Bacon,
teaches an entire city full of people with sticks up their butts that dancing, well...
It's the greatest thing there is.
Who put the sticks up their butts?
What? No, that's just a...
- That is cruel. - It's just a phrase
people use.
The melody is pleasant!
- No! - What the hell?
I know who you are, Peter Quill!
And I am not some starry-eyed waif here to succumb to your...
Your pelvic sorcery!
That is not what is happening here.
No.
Stop it!
What are you doing?
This vermin speaks of affairs he knows nothing about!
- That is true! - He has no respect!
- That is also true! - Hold on! Hold on!
Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!
You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!
Rocket, you're drunk. All right? No one's laughing at you.
He thinks I'm some stupid thing! He does!
Well, I didn't ask to get made!
I didn't ask to be torn apart,
and put back together, over and over
and turned into some...
Some little monster!
Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.
He called me "vermin"!
She called me "rodent"!
Let's see if you can laugh
after five or six good shots to your frickin' face!
No, no, no, no! Four billion units! Rocket!
Come on, man. Hey! Suck it up for one more lousy night and you're rich.
Fine. But I can't promise,
when all this is over I'm not gonna kill every last one of you jerks.
See? That's exactly why none of you have any friends!
Five seconds after you meet somebody, you're already trying to kill them!
We have travelled, halfway across the quadrant.
And Ronan is no closer to being dead.
- Drax! - Let him go.
We don't need him.
Milady Gamora.
I'm here to fetch you for my master.
Okay, this isn't creepy at all.
We house the galaxy's largest collection
of fauna, relics, and species of all manner.
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
Oh, my dear Gamora.
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.
We have what we discussed.
What is that thing there?
I am Groot.
I never thought I'd meet a Groot.
Sir...
You must allow me to pay you now so that I may own your carcass.
At the moment of your death, of course.
I am Groot.
Why, so he could turn you into a frickin' chair?
That's your pet?
- His what? - Tivan.
We have been halfway around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.
Very well, then.
Let us see what you brought.
Three quarnyx batteries, seven cases of Cotati seeds.
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...
You shall send a message for me.
Oh, my new friends.
Before creation itself,
there were six singularities.
Then the universe exploded into existence,
and the remnants of these systems
were forged into concentrated ingots.
Infinity Stones.
These stones, it seems,
can only be brandished
by beings of extraordinary strength.
Observe.
These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations
like wheat in a field.
There's a little pee coming out of me right now.
Once, for a moment,
a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves,
but even they were quickly destroyed by it.
Beautiful.
Beyond compare.
We're all very fascinated, whitey. But we'd like to get paid.
How would you like to get paid?
What do you think, fancy man? Units!
Very well, then.
Carina.
Stand back.
I will no longer be your slave!
No!
What the...
How could I think Tivan could contain whatever was within the Orb?
- What do you still have it for? - What are we gonna do, leave it in there?
- I can't believe you had that in your purse! - It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!
We have to bring this to the Nova Corps. There's a chance they can contain it.
Are you kidding me? We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
- Just give it to Ronan! - So he can destroy the galaxy?
What are you, some saint all of a sudden?
What has the galaxy ever done for you? Why would you wanna save it?
Because I'm one of the idiots who lives in it!
Peter, listen to me. We cannot allow the Stone to fall into Ronan's hands.
We have to go back to your ship, and deliver it to Nova.
Right, right, okay. I think you're right.
Or we could give it to somebody who's not going to arrest us,
who's really nice for a whole lot of money.
I think it's a really good balance between both of your points of view.
You're despicable. Dishonorable.
Faithless!
- No. - At last!
I shall meet my foe and destroy him.
You called Ronan?
Quill! Don't you move, boy!
Don't you move! Get out of the way!
Ronan the Accuser!
You are the one who transmitted the message?
You killed my wife.
You killed my daughter!
I told you, you can't fit. Now, wait here. I'll be back.
It is Gamora. She is escaping with the Orb.
No!
Nebula,
retrieve the Orb.
The Stone is in the furthest pod.
Bring it down!
Rocket, keep them off Gamora until she gets to the Milano.
How? We've got no weaponry on these things.
These pods are industrial grade.
They're nearly indestructible.
Not against necroblasts, they're not.
That's not what I'm saying.
Let me borrow your ride.
I don't recall killing your family.
I doubt I'll remember killing you, either.
Quill, I'm trapped. I can't make it to the Milano.
I have to head out.
Wait! These things aren't meant to go out there.
You are a disappointment, sister.
Of all our siblings,
I hated you least.
Nebula, please.
If Ronan gets this stone
- he'll kill us all. - Not all.
You will already be dead.
Ronan, it is done.
Quill, come on.
Her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes,
but there's nothing we can do for her.
These pods aren't meant to be out here.
In a second, we're gonna be in the same boat.
Damn it.
Quill?
Yondu! Yondu.
This is Quill!
- My coordinates are 227 K324. - Quill.
Quill, what are you doing?
Just outside Knowhere.
If you're there, come get me.
I'm all yours.
Quill, don't be ridiculous.
Get back into your pod!
You can't fit two people in there. You're gonna die.
You'll die in seconds!
Quill.
Quill?
What happened?
I saw you out there.
I don't know what came over me.
But I couldn't let you die.
I found something inside of myself.
Something
incredibly heroic.
I mean, not to brag,
but, objectively...
Where's the Orb?
It's... Well, they got the Orb.
What?
Welcome home, Peter.
Blasted idiot. They're all idiots!
Quill just got himself captured.
None of this ever would have happened if you didn't try to single-handedly
take on a frickin' army!
You're right.
I was a fool.
All the anger,
all the rage,
was just to cover my loss.
"My wife and child are dead."
I don't care if it's mean!
Everybody's got dead people.
It's no excuse to get everybody else
dead along the way!
Come on, Groot. Ronan has the Stone.
The only chance we got is to get to the other side of the universe
as fast as we can and maybe,
just maybe, we'll be able to live full lives before that whack-job ever gets there.
I am Groot.
Save them? How?
I am Groot.
I know they're the only friends that we ever had,
but there's an army of Ravagers around them.
And there's only two of us!
Three.
You're making me
beat... up
grass!
The Orb is in my possession,
as I promised.
Bring it to me.
Yes, that was our agreement.
Bring you the Orb,
and you will destroy Xandar for me.
However, now that I know it contains an Infinity Stone,
I wonder what use I have for you.
Boy,
I would reconsider your current course.
Master! You cannot!
Thanos is the most powerful being in the universe.
Not anymore.
You call me "boy!"
I will unfurl 1,000 years of Kree justice on Xandar,
and burn it to its core!
Then, Thanos,
I am coming for you.
After Xandar, you are going to kill my father?
You dare to oppose me?
You see what he has turned me into.
If you kill him, I will help you destroy a thousand planets.
You betray me?
Steal my money?
Stop it! Leave him alone!
When I picked you up as a kid,
these boys wanted to eat you.
They ain't never tasted Terran before.
I saved your life!
Will you shut up about that? God!
Twenty years, you been throwing that in my face,
like it's some great thing, not eating me.
Normal people don't even think about eating someone else!
Much less that person having to be grateful for it!
You abducted me, man.
You stole me from my home and from my family.
You don't give a damn about your Terra!
You're scared
because you're soft in here.
Here, right here!
Yondu!
Listen to me.
Ronan has something called an Infinity Stone.
I know what he's got, girl.
Then you know we must get it back!
He's gonna use it to wipe out Xandar.
We have to warn them. Billions of people will perish.
Is that what she's been filling your head with, boy?
Sentiment?
Eating away your brain like maggots!
That's it.
No!
Sorry, boy.
But a captain's gotta teach his men what happens to those what cross him.
Captain's gotta teach stuff!
If you kill me now,
you are saying goodbye to the biggest score you have ever seen.
The Stone?
I hope you got something better than that.
Because ain't nobody stealing from Ronan.
We got a ringer.
Is that right?
She knows everything there is to know about Ronan.
His ships,
his army.
He's vulnerable.
Hey, what do you say, Yondu?
Me and you, taking down a mark side-by-side, like the old days.
Let him go!
You always did have a scrote, boy!
That's why I kept you on as a young'un.
Captain, the shot was non-damaging.
Attention, idiots.
The lunatic on top of this craft is holding a Hadron Enforcer.
It's a weapon of my own design.
What the hell?
If you don't hand over our companions now,
he's gonna tear your ship a new one.
A very big new one!
- I ain't buyin' it. - I'm giving you to the count of five.
- 5, 4, 3... - No! Wait, hold on!
Rocket, it's me, for God sakes!
We figured it out! We're fine!
Hey, Quill. What's going on?
You call that "figured it out"?
We're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless.
You want to talk about senseless?
How about trying to save us by blowing us up?
We were only gonna blow you up if they didn't turn you over!
And how on earth were they gonna turn us over
when you only gave them a count of five?
We didn't have time to work out the minutiae of the plan.
This is what we get for acting altruistically.
- I am Groot. - They are ungrateful.
What's important now is we get the Ravagers' army to help us save Xandar.
So we can give the Stone to Yondu who's just gonna sell to somebody even worse?
- We'll figure that part out later. - We have to stop Ronan.
How?
- I have a plan. - You've got a plan?
Yes.
First of all, you're copying me from when I said I had a plan.
No, I'm not. People say that all the time. It's not that unique of a thing to say.
Secondly, I don't even believe you have a plan.
I have part of a plan!
What percentage of a plan do you have?
You don't get to ask questions after the nonsense you pulled on Knowhere.
I just saved Quill.
We've already established that you destroying the ship that I'm on is not saving me.
- When did we establish it? - Like three seconds ago!
I wasn't listening. I was thinking of something else.
She's right. You don't get an opinion. What percentage?
- I don't know. Twelve percent. - Twelve percent?
That's a fake laugh.
- It's real! - Totally fake.
That is the most real, authentic, hysterical laugh of my entire life
- because that is not a plan. - It's barely a concept.
- You're taking their side? - I am Groot.
So what, it's better than 11%? What the hell does that have to do with anything?
Thank you, Groot. Thank you.
See? Groot's the only one of you who has a clue.
Guys.
Come on.
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.
He expects to hear this big plan of ours.
I need your help.
I look around at us.
You know what I see?
Losers.
I mean, like,
folks who have lost stuff.
And we have. Man, we have. All of us.
Our homes,
our families,
normal lives.
And, usually, life takes more than it gives. But not today.
Today, it's given us something.
It has given us a chance.
To do what?
To give a shit.
For once.
Not run away.
I, for one, am not gonna stand by and watch
as Ronan wipes out billions of innocent lives.
But, Quill, stopping Ronan,
it's impossible.
You're asking us to die.
Yeah, I guess I am.
Quill.
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies.
I will be grateful to die among my friends.
You are an honorable man, Quill.
I will fight beside you.
And in the end,
I will see my wife and daughter again.
I am Groot.
What the hell. I don't got that long a lifespan, anyway.
Now I'm standing. Y'all happy?
We're all standing up now.
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle.
The Stone reacts to anything organic.
The bigger the target, the bigger the power surge.
All Ronan's got to do is touch the Stone to the planet's surface and zap.
All plants, animals,
- Nova Corps. - Everything will die.
So Ronan does not make the surface.
Rocket will lead a team to blow a hole
in the Dark Aster's starboard hull.
Then, our craft and Yondu's will enter.
Won't there be hundreds of Sakaaran soldiers inside?
I think of Sakaaran as paper people.
Once they know we're on board,
Ronan will isolate himself behind impenetrable security doors on deck.
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.
We'll make it to the flight deck,
and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.
Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone.
Use these devices to contain it.
If you touch it,
it will kill you.
I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.
There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.
That guy's eye.
No! No, we don't. No, we don't need
that guy's eye.
No, seriously, I need it! It's important to me.
Ronan's fleet has been spotted, and will arrive in T-minus
fifteen minutes.
Remember, boy.
At the end of all this,
I get the Stone.
You cross me, we kill you all.
Let's go get 'em, boys!
This is a terrible plan.
Hey, you're the one who said you wanted to die among friends.
Nova Prime.
I received a transmission
from one of the Ravagers.
He says Ronan's in possession of something called an Infinity Stone
and he's headed toward Xandar.
Good God.
It's a trick. He's a criminal.
Did he say why we should believe him?
He said his crew just escaped from prison
so he'd have no other reason to risk coming to Xandar to help.
He says that he's an
"a-hole."
But he's not,
and I'm quoting him, here,
"100% a dick."
Do you believe him?
I don't know that I believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am.
I mean, do you believe that he is here to help?
Yeah.
A fleet approaches.
They appear to be Ravagers.
Fire!
Cover it down.
Submerge!
Rocket, hurry!
All pilots, dive!
They're beneath us!
Evacuate the city.
Our priority is to get our people away from the battle.
Forward thrust, now!
Come on!
Quill! Yondu! Now!
Hell!
I'm going down, Quill!
No more games with me, boy!
I'll see you
at the end of this!
There are too many of them, Rocket!
We'll never make it up there!
Peter Quill.
This is Denarian Saal of the Nova Corps.
For the record, I advised against trusting you here.
They got my "dick" message!
Prove me wrong.
Yes!
Yes!
We're just like Kevin Bacon.
The starboard kern has been breached!
We have been boarded.
Continue our approach.
But the Nova Corps have engaged.
None of that will matter once we reach the surface.
Seal security doors!
Now!
Get out of my way!
Oh, man.
All Nova pilots, interlock and form a blockade.
The Dark Aster must not reach the ground.
Locked in!
Locked in.
We're locked in.
I can barely see.
When did you learn to do that?
Pretty sure the answer is
"I am Groot."
The flight deck is 300 meters this way.
I want you all to know that I am grateful for your acceptance after my blunders.
It is pleasing to once again have
friends.
You, Quill, are my friend.
Thanks.
This dumb tree, he is my friend.
- And this green whore, she, too... - You must stop!
Gamora, look at what you have done. You have always been weak.
You stupid, traitorous...
Nobody talks to my friends like that.
Head to the flight deck. I'll shut down the power to the security doors.
Yondu Udonta.
Order your men to turn on the Nova Corps.
Enough nonsense, Ravager!
Time to die...
Nebula, please.
Enough of this. Necrocraft pilots,
enact immolation initiative.
They're dive-bombing the city!
Denarian Saal, should we break formation?
No! Hold your positions.
Keep Ronan up there, Saal.
We'll take care of the people down here.
I can't believe I'm taking orders from a hamster.
Star-Lord.
Finally.
You thief!
You will never make it to Ronan.
Everybody shoot them before they hit the ground.
Come on!
Finger to the throat means death.
Metaphor.
Yeah, sorta.
No.
Xandar!
You stand accused.
Your wretched peace treaty will not
save you now.
It is the tinder on which you burn.
Rocket!
Hold on, Saal, just...
Quill, you gotta hurry.
The city's been evacuated,
but we're getting our asses kicked down here.
Gamora hasn't opened the door!
Nebula!
Sister, help us fight Ronan.
You know he's crazy.
I know you're both crazy.
No!
What the?
Get out!
You did it!
I was mistaken.
I do remember your family.
Their screams were
pitiful. I...
No, Groot!
You can't.
You'll die.
Why are you doing this?
Why?
We
are
Groot.
I called him an idiot.
You killed Groot!
Behold!
Your guardians of the galaxy.
What fruit have they wrought?
Only that my father and his father
shall finally know vengeance.
People of Xandar,
the time has come
to rejoice and renounce
your paltry gods!
Your salvation is at hand.
Listen to these words.
Now bring it down hard!
What are you doing?
Dance-off, bro. Me and you.
Gamora.
Subtle. Take it back.
What are you doing?
I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom.
No!
Peter! Take my hand!
Take my hand, Peter.
Mom.
Take my hand!
You're mortal!
How?
You said it yourself, bitch.
We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Well, well, well.
Quite the light show.
Ain't this sweet.
But you got some business to attend to
before all the nookie-nookie starts.
Peter, you can't. Peter.
You gotta reconsider this, Yondu. I don't know who you're selling this to,
but the only way the universe can survive is if you give it to the Nova Corps.
I may be as pretty as an angel,
but I sure as hell ain't one.
Hand it over, son.
Yondu.
Do not open that Orb. You know that, right?
You've seen what it does to people.
Yeah, Quill turned out okay.
It's probably good we didn't deliver him to his dad
like we was hired to do.
Yeah, that guy was a jackass.
He is gonna be so pissed when he realizes I switched out the Orb on him.
He was gonna kill you, Peter.
I know.
But he was about the only family I had.
No.
He wasn't.
Why would you even know this?
When we arrested you, we noticed an anomaly in your nervous system,
so we had it checked out.
I'm not Terran?
You are half Terran.
Your mother was of Earth. Your father, well,
he's something very ancient we've never seen here before.
That could be why you were able to hold the Stone for as long as you did.
Your friends have arrived.
On behalf of the Nova Corps,
we'd like to express our profound gratitude for your help in saving Xandar.
If you will follow Denarian Dey,
- he has something to show you. - Thank you, Nova Prime.
Your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them.
Yes.
Of course, Ronan was only a puppet.
It's really Thanos I need to kill.
We tried to keep it as close to the original as possible.
We salvaged as much as we could.
I...
Thank you.
I have a family.
They're alive because of you.
Your criminal records have also been expunged.
However, I have to warn you against breaking any laws in the future.
Question. What if I see something that I want to take,
- and it belongs to someone else? - You will be arrested.
But what if I want it more than the person who has it?
- It's still illegal. - That doesn't follow.
No, I want it more, sir. Do you understand? What are you laughing at?
Why? I can't have a discussion with this gentleman?
What if someone does something irksome
and I decide to remove his spine?
That's...
That's actually murder.
It's one of the worst crimes of all.
So... also illegal.
They'll be fine, Dey.
I'm gonna keep an eye on 'em.
You?
Yeah. Me.
Peter,
I know these last few months have been hard for you.
But I'm going to a better place.
And I will be okay.
And I will always be with you.
You are the light of my life.
My precious son.
My little Star-Lord.
Love, Mom.
So, what should we do next?
Something good?
Something bad?
A bit of both?
We'll follow your lead, Star-Lord.
Bit of both.
What do you let it lick you like that for?
Gross.
Yeah!
But it burns going down.

There's a girl in this harbor town
And she works layin' whiskey down
They say, "Brandy, fetch another round"
And she serves them whiskey and wine
The sailors say "Brandy, you're a fine girl"
"What a good wife you would be"
- Come on! - Slow down!
This way, my river lily! Come on!
Where are you taking me?
Come on, come on.
Look. Look!
Oh, it's beautiful!
I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil...
but it rooted quickly.
And soon, it'll be everywhere.
All across the universe.
Well, I don't know what you're talking about...
but I like the way you say it.
My heart is yours...
Meredith Quill.
I can't believe I fell in love with a spaceman.
Showtime, a-holes!
It will be here any minute.
Which will be its loss.
I thought your thing was a sword?
We've been hired to stop an interdimensional beast...
from feeding on those batteries, and I'm gonna stop it with a sword?
It's just, swords were your thing and guns were mine.
But I guess we're both doing guns now. I just didn't know that.
Drax, why aren't you wearing one of Rocket's aero-rigs?
It hurts.
It hurts?
I have sensitive nipples.
"My nipples hurt! Oh, goodness me!"
What about him? What's he doing?
I'm finishing this so we can listen to tunes while we work.
How is that a priority?
Blame Quill. He's the one who loves music so much.
No, I actually agree with Drax on this.
That's hardly important right now.
Oh, okay. Sure, Quill.
No, seriously, I side with Drax.
No, I understand that. You're being very serious right now.
I can clearly see you winking.
Damn it. I'm using my left eye?
I am Groot.
They were not looking at you funny.
Well, that's intense.
Groot!
Groot, get out of the way! You're gonna get hurt!
Hi.
No! Spit it out!
Come on!
Disgusting!
The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.
I must cut through it from the inside.
Huh?
No, no! Drax, wait a minute!
Drax!
What is he doing?
He said the skin is too thick to be pierced from the outside, so he...
- That doesn't make any sense! - I tried telling him that!
Skin is the same level of thickness from the inside as from the outside!
I realize that.
There is a cut on its neck.
Rocket, get it to look up.
Hey, you giant Sea-Monkey! Up here!
Watch it, Quill!
Yes! I have single-handedly...
vanquished the beast!
What?
What are they called again?
Anulax batteries.
Harbulary batteries.
That's nothing like what I just said.
But they're worth thousands of units apiece...
which is why the Sovereign hired us to protect them.
Careful what you say around these folks. They're easily offended.
The cost of transgression is death.
We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.
We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.
Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.
We control the DNA of our progeny...
germinating them in birthing pods.
I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.
Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson...
in the archaic ways of our ancestors.
For academic purposes.
I would be honored, yes.
In the name of research...
I think that could be pretty, uh...
repulsive.
I'm not into that kind of casual...
Oh, please.
Your people promised something in exchange for our services.
Bring it...
and we shall gladly be on our way.
Family reunion. Yay.
I understand she is your sister.
She's worth no more to me than the bounty due for her on Xandar.
Our soldiers apprehended her attempting to steal the batteries.
Do with her as you please.
We thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.
What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?
My mother is from Earth.
And your father?
He ain't from Missouri. That's all I know.
I see it within you.
An unorthodox genealogy.
A hybrid that seems particularly...
reckless.
You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags...
but that isn't true at all.
Oh, shit.
I'm using my wrong eye again, aren't I?
I'm sorry. That was meant to be behind your back.
Count yourself blessed they didn't kill you.
You're telling me.
You wanna buy some batteries?
All right, let's get baldy to Xandar
and collect that bounty.
That stuff about my father...
Who does she think she is?
I know you're sensitive about that.
I'm not sensitive about it. I just don't know who he is.
Sorry if it seemed like I was flirting with the High Priestess.
I wasn't.
I don't care if you were.
Well, I feel like you do care.
That's why I'm apologizing. So, sorry!
Gamora is not the one for you, Quill.
Damn shadow.
There are two types of beings in the universe...
those who dance, and those who do not.
Mmm-hmm.
I first met my beloved at a war rally.
Oh, God.
Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.
Except one woman.
My Ovette.
I knew immediately she was the one for me.
The most melodic song in the world could be playing.
She wouldn't even tap her foot.
Wouldn't move a muscle.
One might assume she was dead.
That does sound pretty hot.
It would make my nether regions engorge.
Okay. I get it, yes.
I'm a dancer, Gamora is not.
You just need to find a woman who is pathetic... like you.
Mmm.
I'm hungry. Hand me some of that yaro root.
No. It's not ripe yet...
and I hate you.
You hate me?
You left me there while you stole that stone for yourself.
And yet here you stand, a hero.
I will be free of these shackles soon enough, and I will kill you.
I swear.
No.
You're gonna live out the rest of your days
in a prison on Xandar...
wishing you could.
This is weird.
We've got a Sovereign fleet approaching from the rear.
Why would they do that?
Probably because Rocket stole some of their batteries.
Dude!
Right.
He didn't steal some of those.
I don't know why they're after us. What a mystery this is.
What were you thinking?
Dude, they were really easy to steal!
- That's your defense? - Come on!
You saw how that High Priestess talked down to us.
Now I'm teaching her a lesson!
Oh, I didn't realize your motivation was altruism.
It's really a shame the Sovereign have mistaken your intentions...
- and they're trying to kill us. - Exactly!
I was being sarcastic!
Oh, no!
You're supposed to use a sarcastic voice!
Now I look foolish!
Can we put the bickering on hold...
until after we survive this massive space battle?
- More incoming! - Good!
I wanna kill some guys!
You're not killing anyone.
All those ships are remotely piloted.
Damn it!
What is the delay, Admiral?
High Priestess, the batteries, they are exceptionally combustible...
and could destroy the entire fleet.
Our concern is their slight against our people.
We hired them and they steal from us.
It is heresy of the highest order.
All command modules...
fire with the intent to kill.
What's the nearest habitable planet?
It's called Berhert.
- How many jumps? - Only one.
But the access point is 47 clicks away.
And you have to go through that quantum asteroid field.
Quill, to make it through that...
you'd have to be the greatest pilot in the universe.
Lucky for us, I...
I am.
What are you doing?
I've been flying this rig since I was 10 years old.
I was cybernetically engineered to pilot a spacecraft.
You were cybernetically engineered to be a douchebag!
Stop it.
Later on tonight, you're gonna be laying down in your bed...
and there's gonna be something squishy in your pillow case.
And you're gonna be like, "What's this?"
And it's gonna be because I put a turd in there!
You put your turd in my bed, I shave you.
Oh, it won't be my turd.
It will be Drax's.
I have famously huge turds.
We're about to die, and this is what we're discussing?
Son of a...
Dude! Seriously!
Hey! Let me...
Idiots!
Well, that's what you get
when Quill flies.
Ow!
We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.
Our weapons are down.
20 clicks to the jump!
Hold on.
It's not ripe.
Come on, Zylak. You can do this.
Yes!
15 clicks to the jump!
Come on!
Keep going!
10 clicks!
Die, spaceship!
You suck, Zylak.
Typical.
Five clicks!
Son of a...
They went around the field!
Someone destroyed all our ships!
What?
Who?
One click!
- What is that? - Who cares?
That's the jump point! Go!
It's a guy.
Oh, my God.
He's still out there?
Groot, put your seatbelt on!
Prepare for a really bad landing!
That was awesome!
Yes!
Look at this!
Where is the other half of our ship?
My ship.
Either one of you could have gotten us through that field...
had you flown with what's between your ears
instead of what's between your legs!
If what's between my legs had a hand on it...
I guarantee I could have landed this ship with it.
Peter, we almost died because of your arrogance.
More like because he stole...
the Anulax batteries!
They're called Harbulary batteries.
No, they're not!
Do you know why I did it, Star-Munch? Hmm?
I'm not gonna answer to "Star-Munch."
I did it because I wanted to!
Dick.
What are we even talking about this for?
We just had a little man save us by blowing up 50 ships!
How little?
Well, I don't know, like this?
A little one-inch man saved us?
Well, if he got closer, I'm sure he would be much larger.
That's how eyesight works, you stupid raccoon.
Don't call me a raccoon!
I'm sorry. I took it too far.
I meant trash panda.
Is that better?
I don't know.
It's worse. It's so much worse.
You son of a...
Hey!
- I've had it with you! - No! Back up!
Someone followed you through the jump point.
Set me free, you'll need my help.
I'm not a fool, Nebula.
You are a fool if you deprive yourself a hand in combat.
You'll attack me the moment I let you go.
No, I won't.
You'd think an evil supervillain would learn how to properly lie.
I bet it's the one-inch man.
After all these years, I've found you.
And who the hell are you?
I figured my rugged good looks would make that obvious.
My name is Ego...
and I'm your dad, Peter.
You know what they say...
"You're out of luck until you've gone duck."
Yondu!
Come on down!
After going around years in circles...
with this woman I end up marrying.
I said, "Aleta, I love you, girl...
"but you're losing your mind!"
Then again, she's always been that way.
I could never trust her. You know?
Stakar.
It's been some time.
It seems like this establishment is the wrong kind of disreputable.
- Sir! - Stakar!
There's a hundred Ravager factions.
You lost the business of 99 of them by serving one.
Please, sir. Please!
Get away from me.
You can go to hell then!
I don't give a damn what you think of me!
So what are you following us for?
Because you're gonna listen to what I gotta say!
I don't gotta listen to nothing!
You betrayed the code!
Ravagers don't deal in kids.
I told you before! I didn't know what was going on!
You didn't know because
you didn't want to know because it made you rich.
I demand a seat at the table!
I wear these flames, same as you.
You may dress like us...
but you'll never hear the Horns of Freedom when you die, Yondu.
And the Colors of Ogord...
will never flash over your grave.
If you think...
I take pleasure in exiling you...
you're wrong.
You broke all our hearts.
Ah, pathetic.
First, Quill betrays us...
and Yondu just lets him go scot-free.
We followed him because he was the one...
who wasn't afraid to do what needed to be done.
Seems he's goin' soft.
If he's so soft, why are you whispering?
You know I'm right, Kraglin.
You best be very careful what you say about our captain.
Who the hell is that?
Yondu Udonta...
I have a proposition for you.
I hired Yondu to pick you up...
when your mother passed away.
But instead of returning you...
Yondu kept you.
I have no clue as to why.
Well, I'll tell you why.
Because I was a skinny little kid
who could squeeze into places adults couldn't.
It made it easier for thievin'.
Well, I've been trying to track you down ever since.
I thought Yondu was your father.
What? We've been together this whole time...
and you thought Yondu was my actual blood relative?
You look exactly alike.
One's blue!
No, he's not my father!
Yondu was the guy who abducted me...
kicked the crap out of me so I could learn to fight...
and kept me in terror by threatening to eat me.
- Eat you? - Yeah.
Oh, that son of a bitch.
How'd you locate us now?
Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known...
we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.
What say we head out there right now?
Your associates are welcome. Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
I promise you...
it's unlike any other place you've ever seen.
And there...
I can explain your very special heritage.
Finally get to be...
the father I've always wanted to be.
Excuse me.
I've gotta take a whiz.
I'm not buying it.
Let's go take a walk.
I am Mantis.
What are you doing?
Smiling.
I hear it is the thing to do to make people like you.
Not if you do it like that.
Oh...
I was raised alone on Ego's planet.
I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.
Can I pet your puppy? It is adorable.
Yes.
That is called a practical joke!
I liked it very much!
I just made it up!
Give me a break!
After all this time,
you're gonna show up, and all of a sudden...
- you wanna be my dad? - I hear you.
And by the way, this could be a trap.
The Kree purists, the Ravagers...
- they all want us dead. - I know, but...
But what?
What was that story you told me about Zardu Hasselfrau?
Who?
He owned a magic boat?
David Hasselhoff?
Right.
Not a magic boat. A talking car.
Why did he talk again?
To help him fight crime, and to be supportive.
As a child, you would carry his picture in your pocket...
and you would tell all the other children...
that he was your father, but that he was out of town.
Shooting Knight Rider or touring with his band in Germany.
I told you that when I was drunk. Why are you bringing that up now?
I love that story.
I hate that story.
It's so sad!
As a kid, I used to see all the other kids off playing catch with their dad.
And I wanted that, more than anything in the world!
That's my point, Peter.
What if this man is your Hasselhoff?
If he ends up being evil...
we will just kill him.
You're leaving me with that fox?
He's not a fox.
Shoot her if she does anything suspicious.
- Or if you feel like it. - Okay.
It'll be just a couple of days.
We'll be back before Rocket's finished fixing the ship.
What if the Sovereign come?
There's no way for them to know we're here. Let's go.
I'm uncertain about parting ways.
God, you're like an old woman.
Because I'm wise?
Why do you have so much luggage?
I don't want Groot playing with my things.
I hope Daddy isn't as big of a dick as you, orphan boy.
What is your goal here? To get everybody to hate you?
Because it's working.
And if you don't love me now You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?
Oh...
No one has ever asked me a personal question.
Your antennae, what are they for?
Their purpose?
Yes. Quill and I have a bet.
Dude. You're not supposed to say that!
I say...
if you are about to go through a doorway that is too low...
your antennae will feel this, and keep you from being decapitated.
Right. And if it's anything other than...
you specifically not being decapitated by a doorway, I win.
They are not for feeling doorways.
I think...
they have something to do with my empathic abilities.
What are those?
If I touch someone, I can feel their feelings.
- You read minds? - No.
Telepaths know thoughts.
Empaths feel feelings.
Emotions.
May I?
All right.
You feel love.
Yeah. I guess I feel a general, unselfish love for just about everybody.
No!
Romantic, sexual love.
No, I don't.
- For her! - No!
Okay.
She just told everyone your deepest, darkest secret!
Dude, I think you're overreacting a little bit!
You must be so embarrassed!
Do me! Do me!
I have never felt such humor!
So unbelievably uncool.
Oh, Quill.
Touch me, and the only thing you're gonna feel is a broken jaw.
I can also alter emotions to some extent.
Yeah, like what?
If I touch someone who is sad...
I can ease them into contentment for a short while.
I can make a stubborn person compliant.
But I mostly use it to help my master sleep.
He lies awake at night thinking about his progeny.
Do one of those on me.
Sleep.
I love this song.
Huh?
There!
Ah...
Ain't so tough now without all your toys...
are you?
Move!
Crap.
Hey there, rat!
How's it going, you blue idiot?
Not so bad.
We got ourselves a pretty good little gig here.
This golden gal with quite a high opinion of herself...
has offered us a large sum to deliver you and your pals over to her...
because she wants
to kill y'all.
Your friend...
There's too many of them.
He needs my help. If you care about him...
you need to get me out of these bonds.
They are going to kill him!
I tell you, it was pretty easy to find you.
I put a tracer on your ship back there...
during the war over Xandar.
Give me your word you won't hurt Groot...
and I'll tell you where the batteries are.
Lucky for you, my word don't mean squat.
Otherwise, I'd actually hand you over.
Otherwise, you'd what?
We'll take them batteries.
They're worth what? A quarter mill on the open market?
That Priestess offered us a million.
A quarter is only one third of that!
A quarter ain't a third.
A quarter is 25.
No.
We can't even buy a pair of boots with 25 units.
Enough!
The point is, we ain't stupid enough to help kill the Guardians of the Galaxy!
The whole dang Nova Corps would be on us.
That ain't right!
I just gotta say it this one time, Captain.
No matter how many times Quill betrays you...
you protect him like none of the rest of us much matter!
Yeah!
I'm the one what sticks up for you!
Take it easy, Kraglin.
Damn straight, lad. He's gone soft.
Suppose it's time for a change in leadership.
Put your damn guns down!
Whoa! Whoa!
There must be some kind of peaceful resolution to this, fellas.
Or even a violent one where I'm standing over there.
Well, hello, boys.
It's not ripe.
Welcome, everyone, to my world.
Wow. You have your own planet?
Come on. No larger than your Earth's Moon.
Humility.
I like it.
I, too, am extraordinarily humble.
You own a planet and can destroy two dozen spaceships without a suit.
What are you exactly?
I'm what's called a Celestial, sweetheart.
A Celestial, like a god?
Mmm, small "g," son.
At least on the days I'm feeling humble as Drax.
Whoa!
I don't know where I came from exactly.
First thing I remember is flickering...
adrift in the cosmos utterly...
and entirely alone.
Over millions of years...
I learned to control the molecules around me.
I grew smarter and stronger.
And I continued building from there...
layer by layer...
the very planet you walk on now.
Whoa.
But I wanted more.
I desired...
meaning.
"There must be some life out there in the universe...
"besides just me," I thought.
And so, I set myself the task of finding it.
I created...
what I imagined biological life to be like...
down to the most minute detail.
Did you make a penis?
Dude!
What is wrong with you?
If he is a planet, how could he make a baby with your mother?
He would smush her!
I don't need to hear how my parents...
Why?
My father would tell the story
of impregnating my mother every winter solstice.
That's disgusting.
It was beautiful.
You Earthers have hang-ups.
Yes, Drax, I got a penis.
Ha! Thank you!
It's not half bad.
- Oh. - Ugh.
I've also got pain receptors, and a digestive system...
and all the accompanying junk.
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human...
as I set out amongst the stars...
until I found...
what I sought.
Life.
I was not alone in the universe after all.
When did you meet my mother?
Not long after.
It was with Meredith that I first experienced love.
I called her my river lily.
And from that love, Peter...
you.
I have searched for you for so long.
And when I heard of a man from Earth...
who held an Infinity Stone in his hand without dying...
I knew you must be the son of the woman I loved.
If you loved her, why did you leave her?
This is mutiny!
This is mutiny!
You're scum!
Oh!
Captain!
Help me! Please!
Captain!
You're the one what killed those men...
by leading them down the wrong path.
Because you're weak.
And stupid!
It's time for the Ravagers...
to rise once again to glory with a new captain...
Taserface!
I'm sorry. Your name is...
It's Taserface?
That's right.
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?
It's metaphorical!
Yeah!
For what?
For it is a name what strikes fear...
into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
Okay.
Okay...
whatever you say.
You shut up.
You're next.
Udonta, I have waited a long time to do...
What?
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!
I just keep imagining you waking up in the morning, sir...
looking in the mirror and then in all seriousness saying to yourself...
"You know what would be a really kick-ass name?
"Taserface!"
That's how I hear you in my head!
What was your second choice?
Scrotum Hat?
New plan. We're killing you first.
Well, dying is certainly better than having to live an entire life...
as a moronic shitbag who thinks Taserface is a cool name.
That's enough killing for today.
She's the daughter of Thanos.
I thought you were the biggest sadist in the galaxy.
That was when Daddy was paying my bills.
The Priestess wants to kill the fox herself.
And he has bounties on his head in at least 12 Kree provinces.
I assure you...
I am not as easy a mark as an old man without his magic stick...
or a talking woodland beast.
I want 10% of the take...
and a couple more things.
We got a whole box of hands...
- if that one don't work out. - It is fine.
You think them Kree is gonna execute the captain?
The Kree consider themselves merciful. It will be painless.
Well, here it is. It's the best ship we got.
Location of Ego's planet in the nav.
We'll wire you the 10% once we's paid.
What are you gonna do with your share?
As a child, my father would have Gamora and me
battle one another in training.
Every time my sister prevailed...
my father would replace a piece of me with machinery...
claiming he wanted me to be her equal.
But she won...
again and again, and again, never once refraining.
So after I murder my sister...
I will buy a warship
with every conceivable instrument of death.
I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly...
piece by piece...
until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain...
I know every single day.
Yeah.
I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.
Or a nice hat.
Something to make the other girls go, "Ooh, that's nice!"
Anyways, happy trails.
My mother told everyone my father was from the stars.
She had brain cancer, so everyone thought she was delusional.
Peter...
Listen, I'd love to believe all of this, I really would.
But you left...
the most wonderful woman ever...
to die alone.
I didn't want to leave your mother, Peter.
If I don't return regularly to my planet...
and the light within it...
this form will wither and perish.
So why didn't you come back? Why did you send Yondu?
A criminal, of all people, to come and fetch me?
I loved your mother, Peter!
I couldn't stand to set foot on an Earth...
where she wasn't living! You can't imagine what that's like!
I know exactly what that feels like!
I had to watch her die!
Over the millions and millions of years of my existence...
I've made many mistakes, Peter.
But you're not one of them.
Please give me the chance to be the father she would want me to be.
There's so much that I need to teach you about this planet...
and the light within.
They are a part of you, Peter.
What do you mean?
Give me your hands, son.
Here.
Hold them like that.
Now, close your eyes and concentrate.
Take your brain to the center of this planet.
Yes!
Whoa!
Yes! It's okay.
Just relax. Concentrate.
You can do it. Bring it back.
Yes!
Yes, now shape it.
Feel that energy.
Yes.
You're home.
Peter...
How did you get to this weird, dumb planet?
Ego found me in my larva state.
Orphaned on my homeworld.
He raised me by hand, and kept me as his own.
So you're a pet?
I suppose.
People usually want cute pets.
Why would Ego want such a hideous one?
I am hideous?
You are horrifying to look at. Yes.
But that's a good thing.
Oh?
When you're ugly, and someone loves you...
you know they love you for who you are.
Beautiful people never know who to trust.
Well, then I'm certainly grateful to be ugly.
Those pools, they remind me of a time...
when I took my daughter to the forgotten lakes of my homeworld.
She was like you.
Disgusting?
Innocent.
Drax?
There's something I must tell you.
What's going on?
This gross bug lady is my new friend.
I'm learning many things, like I'm a pet and ugly.
You're not ugly. Drax!
What are you talking about?
Mantis...
can you show us where we'll be staying?
Why are there no other beings on this planet?
The planet is Ego.
A dog would not invite a flea to live on his back.
And you're not a flea?
I'm a flea with a purpose.
I help him sleep.
What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?
Nothing.
Your quarters are this way.
We deliver you to the Kree in the morning.
Neither one of you will last much longer after that.
Okay, Taserface.
Hey, tell the other guys we said...
"Hi," Taserface!
What about this little plant? Can I smash it with a rock?
No, Gef.
It's too adorable to kill.
Take it to the tailor.
No offense, but your employees are a bunch of jerks.
I was a Kree battle slave for 20 years when Stakar freed me.
He offered me a place with the Ravagers.
He said all I needed to do was adhere to the code.
But I was young...
and greedy, and stupid.
Like you stealing those batteries.
That was mostly Drax.
Me and Stakar and the other captains...
we weren't so different from you and your friends.
The only family I ever had.
When I broke the code...
they exiled me.
This is what I deserve.
Slow down, drama queen.
You might deserve this, but I don't.
We gotta get outta here.
Where's Quill?
He went off with his old man.
- Ego? - Yeah.
It's a day for dumbass names.
You're smiling. And for a second, I got a warm feeling.
But then it was ruined by those disgusting-ass teeth.
You like a professional asshole or what?
Pretty much a pro.
Why didn't you deliver Quill to Ego like you promised?
He was skinny.
Could fit into places we couldn't. Good for thievin'.
Uh-huh.
I got an idea on how to get outta here.
But we're gonna need your little friend.
Mascot, mascot, mascot...
Little fellow's all worked up! He needs a drink!
Look how cute it is when it's all riled up.
He's goddang precious!
Psst!
Hey, twig!
Come here.
Come on.
Aw, man...
what did they do to you?
Hey, you wanna help us get outta here?
There's something I need you to get, and bring back to me.
In the captain's quarters, there's a prototype fin...
the thing I wore on my head.
There's a drawer next to the bunk. It's in that. It's red.
You got it?
That's my underwears.
Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn't know what you were talkin' about.
You have to explain it more careful.
It's a prototype fin.
That's an orloni. It's a fin, Groot.
You explain it this time.
All right.
That's Vorker's eye.
He takes it out when he sleeps.
Go. Look again.
But leave the eye here.
Why?
He's gonna wake up tomorrow...
and he's not gonna know...
where his eye is!
That's a desk.
We told you it was this big.
Tell me you guys have a refrigerator somewhere...
with a bunch of severed human toes.
Okay. Then let's just agree to never discuss this.
The drawer you wanna open has this symbol on it.
Okay?
What? No!
He thinks you want him to wear it as a hat.
That's not what I said!
I am Groot.
He's relieved you don't want him to.
- I am Groot. - He hates hats.
I am Groot.
On anyone, not just himself.
I am Groot.
One minute you think someone has a weird-shaped head...
the next minute it's just because you realize part of that head is the hat.
That's why you don't like hats?
This is an important conversation right now?
That ain't it.
I didn't mean to do a mutiny.
They killed all my friends.
Get the third quadrant ready for release.
One more thing.
You got any clones of Quill's old music on the ship?
Ah.
He's got it!
Yondu's got the fin!
Go!
Down there!
Oh!
You maniac.
The whole ship's gonna blow.
Not the whole ship.
Who is this?
I am sending you the coordinates for Yondu's ship.
- Release the quadrant! - Aye, Captain!
I only ask one thing.
That your High Priestess...
tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.
Taserface!
Where to, Captain?
Ego.
No, boy!
It ain't healthy for a mammalian body to hop more than 50 jumps at a time.
I know that.
We are about to do 700!
So I guess this could all be mine someday.
Rocket? Rocket, are you there?
What are you doing, Peter?
Dance with me.
I'm not going to dance with you.
This is Sam Cooke...
one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.
Drax thinks you're not a dancer.
If you ever tell anyone about this...
I will kill you.
When are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us?
What unspoken thing?
This...
Cheers, Sam and Diane...
a guy and a girl on a TV show who dig each other...
but never say it because if they do,
the ratings would go down...
sort of thing.
There's no unspoken thing.
Well, it's a catch-22, because if you said it,
then it would be spoken...
and you would be a liar. So, by not saying it...
you are telling the truth, and admitting that there is.
No, that's not what I...
What we should be discussing right now is something about this place.
It doesn't feel right.
What are you talking about?
You're the one who wanted me to come here!
That girl Mantis...
she's afraid of something.
Why are you trying to take this away from me?
I'm not trying...
He's my father. He's blood.
You have blood on Earth and you never wanted to return there.
Again, you made me come here!
And Earth is the place where my mother died in front of me.
No, it's because that place is real, and this is a fantasy.
This is real! I'm only half human, remember?
That's the half I'm worried about.
Oh, I get it. You're jealous...
because I'm part-god, and you like when I'm the weak one.
You were insufferable to begin with.
I haven't been able to reach Rocket.
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.
You know what? This is not Cheers after all!
This is whatever the show is where one person is willing...
to open themselves up to new possibility,
and the other person is a jerk...
who doesn't trust anybody!
It's a show that doesn't exist.
That's why it would get zero ratings!
I don't know what Cheers is!
I finally found my family. Don't you understand that?
I thought you already had.
Damn it.
Psychopath!
Are you kidding me?
I win.
I win. I bested you in combat.
No. I saved your life.
Well, you were stupid enough to let me live.
You let me live!
I don't need you always trying to beat me!
I'm not the one that just flew across the universe
just because I wanted to win.
Do not tell me what I want.
I don't need to tell you what you want!
It's obvious!
You were the one who wanted to win. And I just wanted a sister!
You were all I had.
But you were the one who needed to win.
Thanos pulled my eye from my head...
and my brain from my skull...
and my arm from my body...
because of you.
You all right, son?
I saw your girl stomp off a little earlier in quite a huff.
Yeah.
It's fortuitous...
you listening to this song.
- You know... - Brandy?
By Looking Glass?
A favorite of your mom's.
Yeah, it was.
One of Earth's greatest musical compositions.
Perhaps its very greatest.
Yes!
Peter, you and I, we're the sailor in that song.
He came on a summer's day
Bringing gifts from far away
Like the child I put in your mother...
or the freedom you brought Gamora.
Brandy, you're a fine girl
What a good wife you would be
My life, my love
My lady is the sea
The sea calls the sailor back.
He loves the girl, but that's not his place.
The sea calls upon him as history calls upon great men.
And sometimes we are deprived the pleasures of mortals.
Well, you may not be mortal, but me...
No, Peter...
death will remain a stranger to both of us...
as long as the light burns within the planet.
I'm immortal?
Mmm-hmm.
Really?
Yes! As long as the light exists.
And I can use the light to build cool things...
like how you made this whole planet?
It might take you a few million years of practice...
before you get really good at it. But, yes!
What!
Get ready for an 800-foot statue of Pac-Man with Skeletor...
and Heather Locklear.
You can do anything you want.
I'm gonna make some weird shit.
But you know, Peter, it is a tremendous responsibility.
Only we can remake the universe.
Only we can take the bridle of the cosmos...
and lead it to where it needs to go.
How?
Come with me.
Drax, Drax. Drax!
Drax! We need to talk.
I'm sorry.
But I like a woman with some meat on her bones.
What?
I tried to let you down easily by telling you I found you disgusting.
No, that's not what I...
What are you doing?
I'm imagining being with you physically.
Drax...
I don't like you like that.
I don't even like the type of thing you are.
Hey! There's no need to get personal.
Listen! Ego's gotten exactly what he wanted.
I should have told you earlier.
I'm stupid. You are in danger.
What is that?
Now, you need to readjust the way you process life.
Everything around us, including the girl...
Everything is temporary.
We are forever.
Doesn't eternity get boring?
Not if you have a purpose, Peter...
which is why you're here.
I told you how all those years ago...
I had an unceasing impulse to find life.
But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it...
it was all so...
disappointing.
And that is when I came...
to a profound realization.
My innate desire to seek out other life...
was not so that I could walk among that life.
Peter...
I have found meaning.
I see it.
Eternity!
Oh, my God.
We need to get off this planet.
Oh, man.
Anyway, before I was so rudely interrupted...
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.
What the hell you doing, boy?
I could tell by how you talked about him...
this Ego is bad news.
We're here to save Quill.
For what? Huh? For honor? For love?
No. I don't care about those things.
I wanna save Quill so I can prove I'm better than him!
I can lord this over him forever.
What are you laughing at me for?
You can fool yourself and everyone else, but you can't fool me.
I know who you are.
You don't know anything about me, loser.
I know everything about you.
I know you play like you're the meanest and the hardest...
but, actually, you're the most scared of all.
Shut up!
I know you steal batteries you don't need...
and you push away anyone who's willing to put up with you...
because just a little bit of love...
reminds you how big and empty that hole inside you actually is.
I said shut up!
I know them scientists what made you, never gave a rat's ass about you.
I'm serious, dude!
Just like my own damn parents who sold me...
their own little baby, into slavery.
I know who you are, boy.
Because you're me.
What kind of a pair are we?
The kind that's about to go fight a planet, I reckon.
All right, okay! Good. Wait.
Fight a what?
Who are you people?
What is this place?
Gamora, let her go!
The bodies in the caverns... Who are they?
You are scared.
I call it the Expansion.
It is my purpose...
and now it is yours as well.
It's beautiful.
Over thousands of years...
I implanted thousands of extensions of myself...
on thousands of worlds.
I need to fulfill life's one true purpose...
To grow and spread...
covering all that exists...
until everything is...
Me!
What did she do to me?
She already told me everything.
I only had one problem.
A single Celestial doesn't have enough power
for such an enterprise.
But two Celestials...
Well, now, that just might do.
The bodies...
are his children.
Out of all my labors...
the most beguiling was...
attempting to graft my DNA with that of another species.
I hoped the result of such a coupling would be enough...
to power the Expansion.
I had Yondu deliver some of them to me.
It broke the Ravager code, but I compensated him generously...
and to ease his conscience, I said I'd never hurt them.
I mean, that was true. They never felt a thing.
But one after the other, they failed me.
Not one of them carried the Celestial genes.
Until you, Peter.
Out of all my spawn...
only you carried the connection to the light.
We need to find Peter now, and get off this damn planet.
Ego will have won him to his side by now.
- Then we just go. - No!
- He's our friend. - All any of you do...
is yell at each other. You are not friends.
You're right.
We're family.
We leave no one behind.
Except maybe you.
Oh, my God.
For the first time in my existence...
I am truly not alone!
What is it, son?
My friends.
You see, that's the mortal in you, Peter.
Yes.
We are beyond such things.
Yes.
- Now... - But my mother...
You said you loved my mother.
And that I did.
My river lily who knew all the words to every song that came over the radio.
I returned to Earth to see her three times.
And I knew if I returned a fourth...
I'd never leave.
The Expansion...
the reason for my very existence, would be over.
So, I did what I had to do.
But it broke my heart to put that tumor in her head.
What?
Now, all right...
I know that sounds bad.
Who in the hell do you think you are?
You killed my mother!
I tried...
so hard...
to find the form...
that best suited you...
and this is the thanks I get?
You really need to grow up.
I wanted to do this together...
but I suppose you'll have to learn
by spending the next thousand years as a battery!
Finally! Rocket?
Keep that transmitter nearby, so I can find you.
We're in an old piece of construction equipment Yondu once used...
to slice open the Bank of A 'askavaria.
Ego's unhinged.
I know. Get ready.
Drop her, Kraglin.
No.
My life, my love
My lady is the sea
Peter...
this is the sea.
Oh...
Hey, there, jackass!
What is that thing?
Out of the way, dumber, smaller Groot!
I told you something didn't feel right.
"I told you so." Just what I need to hear right now.
Well, I came back, didn't I?
Because there's an unspoken thing.
There is no unspoken thing.
What are you doing? You could've killed us all!
Uh... "Thank you, Rocket"?
We had it under control.
We did not. That is only an extension...
of his true self. He will be back soon.
What's Smurfette doing here?
Whatever I need to do to get a damn ride home.
She tried to murder me!
I saved you, you stupid fox!
He's not a fox.
- I am Groot. - I'm not a raboon, either.
I am Groot.
"Raccoon." Whatever.
How do we kill a Celestial?
There's a center to him.
His brain, his soul, whatever it is...
Some sort of protective shell.
It's in the caverns...
below the surface.
Yondu?
Thrusters are out.
Guess I should be glad I was a skinny kid.
Otherwise, you'd have delivered me to this maniac.
You still reckon that's the reason
I kept you around, you idiot?
That's what you told me, you old doofus.
Once I figured out what happened to them other kids...
I wasn't just gonna hand you over.
You said you were gonna eat me.
That was being funny!
Not to me!
You people have issues.
Of course I have issues.
That's my freakin' father!
Thrusters are back up.
- We should be going up! - We can't!
Ego wants to eradicate the universe as we know it.
We have to kill him.
Rocket!
Got it!
Whoo-hoo!
So, we're saving the galaxy again?
I guess.
Awesome!
We're really gonna be able to jack up our prices...
if we're two-time galaxy savers.
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.
It was just a random thought, man. I thought we were friends.
Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings...
and all the animals on the planets.
And the people.
Meh.
The crabby puppy is so cute. He makes me wanna die!
Pilots...
release envoy units.
Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet.
Dive!
Um... Captain?
Captain?
Tell me why Ego wants you here?
He needs my genetic connection to the light...
to help destroy the universe.
He tried to teach me how to control the power.
So, could you?
A little.
I made a ball.
A ball?
I thought as hard as I could.
It was all that I could come up with.
You "thought"?
You think when I make this arrow fly...
I use my head?
Whoa.
There.
That's Ego's core.
That ore is thick, Rocket.
I got it covered.
We must hurry.
It will not take Ego long to find us.
Keep it steady.
We drill into the center, we kill him!
Captain?
What is it, Kraglin?
Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?
- Yeah, why? - Uh...
Oh, hell!
Why aren't you firing the lasers?
They blew out the generator.
I think I packed a small detonator.
A detonator is worthless without explosives.
Well, we got these.
Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?
If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction...
throughout his entire nervous system.
Meaning what?
The entire planet will explode.
We'll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.
Go!
He's coming.
Didn't you say you could make him sleep?
When he wants. He's too powerful.
I can't!
You don't have to believe in yourself...
because I believe in you.
Sleep!
I never thought she'd be able to do it...
with as weak and skinny as she appears to be.
I don't know how long I can hold him.
The metal's too thick.
For the bomb to work, we'd actually need to place it on Ego's core.
And our fat butts ain't gonna fit through those tiny holes.
Well...
That's a terrible idea.
Which is the only kind of idea we have left.
Unbelievable.
"Rocket, do this. Rocket, do that."
What a day.
All right, first you flick this switch, then this switch.
That activates it.
Then you push this button...
which will give you five minutes to get out of there.
Now, whatever you do...
don't push this button...
because that will set off the bomb immediately
and we'll all be dead.
Now, repeat back what I just said.
- I am Groot. - Uh-huh.
- I am Groot. - That's right.
- I am Groot. - No!
No, that's the button that will kill everyone!
Try again.
Hmm...
- I am Groot. - Mmm-hmm.
- I am Groot. - Uh-huh.
I am Groot.
No! That's exactly what you just said!
How is that even possible?
Which button is the button you're supposed to push?
Point to it.
No!
Hey, you're making him nervous!
Shut up and get me some tape!
Does anybody have any tape out there?
I wanna put some tape over the death button.
I don't have any tape. Let me check.
Yo, Yondu... Ow!
Do you have any tape?
Gamora? Do you have any tape?
Tape!
Never mind. Ow!
Drax, do you have any tape?
Yes, Scotch tape would work.
Then why did you ask me if Scotch tape would work,
if you don't have any?
Nobody has any tape!
Not a single person has tape?
Nope!
Did you ask Nebula?
Yes!
Are you sure?
I asked Yondu...
- and she was sitting next to him. - I knew you were lying!
You have priceless batteries and an atomic bomb in your bag.
If anybody's gonna have tape, it's you!
That's exactly my point! I have to do everything!
You are wasting a lot of time here!
Whee!
We're all gonna die.
Rear thrusters are out again!
We're done for without that generator!
Guardians...
perhaps it will provide you solace...
that your deaths are not without purpose.
They will serve as a warning...
to all of those tempted with betraying us.
Don't screw with the Sovereign.
This is gonna hurt.
Promises, promises.
Hey!
No!
No! No! No!
We're gonna blow!
Peter! No!
What?
You look like Mary Poppins.
Is he cool?
Hell, yeah, he's cool.
I'm Mary Poppins, y'all!
Mantis, look out!
She's just unconscious.
How long until the bomb goes off?
In the unlikely event that Groot doesn't kill us all...
about six minutes.
Kraglin, we need the quadrant for an extraction.
T-minus five minutes.
Aye, Captain.
Somebody's gotta be up top when Kraglin arrives.
Drax, take Mantis.
Ow! My nipples!
Gamora!
Peter!
Get over it.
Come now, Peter. I know this isn't what you want.
What kind of father would I be to let you make this choice?
Yeah!
Soon, Peter, we will be all there is.
So stop pissing me off!
We have to get up to the extraction point!
Go!
I told you...
I don't want to do this alone.
You cannot deny...
the purpose the universe has bestowed upon you.
Everyone, I need you to stay back!
What is that?
It doesn't need to be like this, Peter.
Why are you destroying our chance?
Stop pretending you aren't what you are.
One in billions.
Trillions. Even more.
What greater meaning can life possibly have to offer?
I don't use my head to fly the arrow, boy!
I use my heart...
You shouldn't have killed my mom, and squished my Walkman.
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you saying
You would never break the chain
Groot? If you can hear me, hurry up!
I'm not sure how long Quill can keep him distracted!
Groot, hurry!
Yondu, we're about to blow!
Get to the ship!
Not without Quill!
You need to take care of the twig!
Not without you!
I ain't done nothin' right my whole damn life, rat.
You need to give me this.
Uh...
A spacesuit and an aero-rig.
I only have one of each.
I am Groot.
What's that?
He says, "Welcome to the frickin' Guardians of the Galaxy."
Only he didn't use "frickin'."
Bye, twig.
We're gonna need to have a real discussion about your language.
Where's Peter?
Rocket, where is he?
Rocket.
Rocket, look at me! Where is he?
Mmm...
No. I'm not leaving without him.
I'm sorry.
I can only afford to lose one friend today.
Kraglin, go!
Wait...
Is Quill back?
Rocket, where's Quill?
Rocket, where's Quill?
Rocket!
Where's Quill?
Where's Quill?
No, we need to stop it.
Stop.
Stop. Listen to me!
You are a god.
If you kill me...
you'll be just like everybody else.
What's so wrong with that?
No!
He may have been your father, boy,
but he wasn't your daddy.
I'm sorry I didn't do none of it right.
I'm damn lucky you're my boy.
What?
Yondu, what are you doing?
You can't.
Yondu!
No!
No!
Oh! Aww...
No! No!
Oh, no!
I told Gamora...
how when I was a kid I used to pretend
David Hasselhoff was my dad.
He's a singer and actor from Earth, really famous guy.
Earlier, it struck me...
Yondu didn't have a talking car, but he did have a flying arrow.
He didn't have the beautiful voice of an angel...
but he did have the whistle of one.
Both Yondu and David Hasselhoff went on kick-ass adventures...
and hooked up with hot women...
and fought robots.
I guess David Hasselhoff did kind of end up being my dad after all.
Only it was you, Yondu.
I had a pretty cool dad.
What I'm trying to say here is...
sometimes that thing you're searching for your whole life...
it's right there by your side all along.
You don't even know it.
I am Groot.
He did call you twig.
Nebula...
I was a child like you.
I was concerned with staying alive until the next day, every day.
And I never considered what Thanos was doing to you.
I'm trying to make it right.
There are little girls like you...
across the universe who are in danger.
You can stay with us and help them.
I will help them by killing Thanos.
I don't know if that's possible.
You will always be my sister.
Pete!
Captain found this for you in a junker shop.
Said you'd come back to the fold someday.
What is it?
It's called a Zune.
It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.
It's got 300 songs on it.
300 songs?
Wait.
Rocket grabbed the pieces, and reassembled them.
I think Yondu would want you to have it.
Thanks...
Captain.
It's not time to make a change
Just relax, take it easy
You're still young, that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl, settle down
If you want you can marry
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy
They came.
What is it?
I sent word to Yondu's old Ravager buddies,
and told them what he did.
It's a Ravager funeral.
Yeah!
Yeah!
He didn't let us down after all, Captain.
No, he did not, son.
He did not.
Fare thee well, old friend.
Yondu Udonta, I will see you in the stars.
He didn't chase them away.
No.
Even though he yelled at them.
And was always mean.
And he stole batteries he didn't need.
Well, of course not.
What?
It's just...
some unspoken thing.
It's beautiful.
It is.
And so are you.
On the inside.
Now there's a way
And I know that I have to go away
I know I have to go
You know, it's a shame...
that it took the tragedy of losing Yondu to bring us all together again.
But I think he'd be proud knowing that we are back as a team.
I'm in.
Dope.
I miss you guys so much!
Hell, yes.
What say we steal some shit?
High Priestess, the Council is waiting.
They are perturbed I've wasted our resources.
When they see what I have created here...
their wrath will dissipate.
It's a new type of birthing pod, ma'am?
That, my child...
is the next step in our evolution.
More powerful, more beautiful...
more capable of destroying the Guardians of the Galaxy.
I think I shall call him...
Adam.
Ugh, dude.
Seriously?
You gotta clean up your room. It's a complete mess.
I am Groot.
I am not boring. You're boring.
You know what's boring?
Sitting there, playing that mind-numbing game.
What's boring is me tripping over your vines every day!
I'm not boring!
I am Groot.
And now I know how Yondu felt.
In these times of hardship...
just remember...
We. Are. Groot.
Hey, fellas.
Wait, where are you going?
You were supposed to be my lift home.
How will I get out of here?
Hey! Aw, gee...
I've got so many more stories to tell.
Aw, guys.
Oh, gee...

Been a while since I was up here in front of you.
Maybe I'll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards.
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred
on the freeway and the rooftop...
Sorry, Mr. Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Yes.
And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped
with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle...
I know that it's confusing.
It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I mean, let's face it, I'm not the heroic type.
A laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
The truth is
I am Iron Man.
Ivan.
Vanya.
270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15,000 feet.
You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone.
Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
It's good to be back.
- You missed me? - Blow something up!
I missed you, too. Blow something up? I already did that.
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying
its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me.
I'm not saying that from the ashes of captivity,
never has a greater Phoenix metaphor been personified in human history.
I'm not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair,
sipping on an iced tea
because I haven't come across anyone who's man enough
to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
I love you, Tony!
Please, it's not about me.
It's not about you.
It's not even about us. It's about legacy.
It's about what we choose to leave behind for future generations.
And that's why for the next year and for the first time since 1974,
the best and brightest men and women
of nations and corporations the world over
will pool their resources, share their collective vision,
to leave behind a brighter future.
It's not about us.
Therefore, what I'm saying, if I'm saying anything,
is welcome back to the Stark Expo.
And now, making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond to tell you what it's all about,
please welcome my father, Howard.
Everything is achievable through technology.
Better living, robust health,
and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.
So, from all of us here at Stark industries,
I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future.
Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,
and will one day rid society of all its ills.
Soon, technology will affect the way you live your life every day.
No more tedious work,
leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life.
The Stark Expo. Welcome.
We are coming to you live from the kickoff of the Stark Expo,
where Tony Stark has just walked offstage.
Don't worry if you can't make it down here tonight
because this Expo goes on all year long.
And I'm gonna be here checking out all the attractions
and the pavilions and the inventions from all around the world.
Make sure you join me...
All right, it's a zoo out there, watch out.
- Open up, let's go. - Hey! Nice to see you.
- All right. Thank you. I remember you. - Tony, Tony...
Hey, hey...
- Call me. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Hello. It would be a pleasure.
- Okay. - See you, buddy.
This is Larry.
Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure.
- Nice to see you. - Call me. Call me.
- Larry King. - Larry!
Yes, my people, my people.
Come on, Tony. There we go.
- Very mellow. - That wasn't so bad.
No, it was perfect.
Look what we got here, the new model.
- Hey, does she come with the car? - I certainly hope so.
- Hi. - Hi.
- And you are? - Marshal.
- Irish. I like it. - Pleased to meet you, Tony.
I'm on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
- Bedford. - What are you doing here?
- Looking for you. - Yeah? You found me.
- What are you up to later? - Serving subpoenas.
He doesn't like to be handed things.
- Yeah, I have a peeve. - I got it.
You are hereby ordered
to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee
tomorrow morning at 9: 00 A.M.
- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?
He likes the badge.
- You still like it? - Yep.
- How far are we from D.C.? - D.C.? 250 miles.
Mr. Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr. Stark. Please.
- Yes, dear? - Can I have your attention?
Absolutely.
Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
- I do not. I do not. - You do not?
Well, it depends on how you define the word "weapon."
- The Iron Man weapon. - My device does not fit that description.
Well... How would you describe it?
I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
- As? - It's a high-tech prosthesis.
That is... That is...
That's actually the most apt description I can make of it.
It's a weapon. It's a weapon, Mr. Stark.
Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen...
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people
- of the United States of America. - Well, you can forget it.
I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one.
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself,
which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution,
depending on what state you're in.
- You can't have it. - Look, I'm no expert...
In prostitution? Of course not. You're a senator. Come on.
I'm no expert in weapons.
We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons.
I'd now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
Let the record reflect that I observed Mr. Hammer entering the chamber,
and I am wondering
if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Absolutely. I'm no expert. I defer to you, Anthony.
You're the wonder boy.
Senator, if I may.
I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert?
Your dad. Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age.
Let's just be clear. He was no flower child.
He was a lion.
We all know why we're here. In the last six months,
Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities.
And yet he insists it's a shield.
He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it.
I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do.
I'd love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house,
but this ain't Canada.
You know, we live in a world of grave threats,
threats that Mr. Stark will not always be able to foresee.
Thank you.
God bless Iron Man. God bless America.
That is well said, Mr. Hammer.
The committee would now like to invite.
Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Rhodey? What?
Hey, buddy. I didn't expect to see you here.
Look, it's me, I'm here. Deal with it. Let's move on.
I just...
- Drop it. - All right, I'll drop it.
I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon,
compiled by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record,
can you please read page 57, paragraph four?
You're requesting that I read specific selections
- from my report, Senator? - Yes, sir.
It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying
in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
I understand. A lot of things have changed today.
- So if you could just read... - You do understand
that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect
- the summary of my final... - Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.
Very well.
"As he does not operate within any definable branch of government,."
"Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation"
"and to her interests."
I did, however, go on to summarise
that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities.
- And that it would be in our interest... - That's enough, Colonel.
To fold Mr. Stark... - That's enough.
Into the existing chain of command, Senator.
I'm not a joiner, but I'll consider Secretary of Defense, if you ask nice.
We can amend the hours a little bit.
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,
the imagery that's connected to your report.
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images
- to the general public at this time. - With all due respect,
Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us, we'd be very grateful.
Let's have the images.
Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos
are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies
of Mr. Stark's suit.
This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground,
indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
Hold on one second, buddy. Let me see something here.
Boy, I'm good. I commandeered your screens.
I need them. Time for a little transparency.
- Now, let's see what's really going on. - What is he doing?
If you will direct your attention to said screens...
I believe that's North Korea.
Can you turn that off? Take it off.
Iran.
No grave immediate threat here. Is that Justin Hammer?
How did Hammer get in the game?
Justin, you're on TV. Focus up.
Okay, give me a left twist. Left's good. Turn to the right.
Oh, shit. Oh, shit!
Wow.
Yeah, I'd say most countries, five, 10 years away.
Hammer Industries, 20.
I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.
I think we're done, is the point that he's making.
- I don't think there's any reason... - The point is, you're welcome, I guess.
- For what? - Because I'm your nuclear deterrent.
It's working. We're safe. America is secure.
You want my property? You can't have it.
But I did you a big favour.
I've successfully privatized world peace.
What more do you want? For now!
I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
You, Mr. Stark... you, buddy.
We're adjourned. We're adjourned for today.
- Okay. - You've been a delight.
My bond is with the people.
And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself.
If there's one thing I've proven
it's that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
Wake up. Daddy's home.
Welcome home, sir.
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing.
And may I say how refreshing it is
to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.
You!
I swear to God I'll dismantle you. I'll soak your motherboard.
I'll turn you into a wine rack.
How many ounces a day of this gobbledegook
am I supposed to drink?
We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.
Check palladium levels.
Blood toxicity, 24%.
It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit
is accelerating your condition.
Another core has been depleted.
God, they're running out quick.
I have run simulations on every known element,
and none can serve as a viable replacement
for the palladium core.
You are running out of both time and options.
Unfortunately, the device that's keeping you alive
is also killing you.
Miss Potts is approaching.
- I recommend that you inform her... - Mute.
Is this a joke?
- What are you thinking? - What?
- What are you thinking? - Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy.
And you're angry about something.
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.
- Did you just donate... - Keep your business.
Our entire modern art collection to the...
- Boy Scouts of America. ...Boy Scouts of America?
Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation.
I didn't physically check the crates but, basically, yes.
And it's not "our" collection, it's my collection. No of fence.
No, you know what? I think I'm actually entitled
to say "our" collection
considering the time that I put in, over 10 years,
- curating that. - It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
You know, there's only about 8,011things
that I really need to talk to you about.
Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out.
The Bridgeport's already machining that part.
The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
I need you to wear a surgical mask until you're feeling better.
- Is that okay? - That's rude.
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.
It's my primary point of concern.
- I don't know why you're... - The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Wow. Look at that.
That's modern art. That's going up.
- You've got to be kidding. - I'm gonna put this up right now.
- This is vital. - Stark is in complete disarray.
- You understand that? - No. Our stocks have never been higher.
- Yes, from a managerial standpoint. - You are... Well, if it's messy,
- then let's double back. - Let me give you an example.
- Let's move on to another subject. - No, no, no, no.
You are not taking down the Barnett Newman
- and hanging that up! - I'm not taking it down.
I'm just replacing it with this.
- Let's see what I can get going here. - Okay, fine.
My point is, we have already awarded contracts
- to the wind farm people. - Yeah. Don't say "wind farm."
- I'm already feeling gassy. - And to the plastic plantation tree,
which was your idea, by the way. Those people are on payroll...
- Everything was my idea... and you won't make a decision.
I don't care about the liberal agenda any more.
It's boring. Boring. I'm giving you a boring alert.
- You do it. - I do what?
Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
- Yeah, I'm trying to run the company. - Pepper, I need you to run the company.
- Well, stop trying to do it and do it. - You will not
- give me the information... - I'm not asking you to try...
in order to... - I'm asking you
to physically do it. I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it. - Pepper, you're not listening to me!
- No, you are not listening to me. - I'm trying to make you CEO.
Why won't you let me?
- Have you been drinking? - Chlorophyll.
I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries,
effective immediately.
Yeah, done deal. Okay?
I've actually given this a fair amount of thought,
believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak,
trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be.
And then I realised
it's you. It's always been you.
I thought there'd be a legal issue,
but actually I'm capable of appointing my successor.
My successor being you.
Congratulations?
- Take it, just take it. - I don't know what to think.
Don't think. Drink.
There you go.
The notary's here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
I'm on happy time.
- Sorry. - What the hell was that?
It's called mixed martial arts. It's been around for three weeks.
It's called dirty boxing. There's nothing new about it.
All right, put them up. Come on.
I promise you this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
I need you to initial each box.
Lesson one. Never take your eye off...
That's it. I'm done.
- What's your name, lady? - Rushman. Natalie Rushman.
Front and center. Come into the church.
- No. You're seriously not gonna ask... - If it pleases the court, which it does.
- It's no problem. - I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.
What?
- Can you give her a lesson? - No problem.
- Pepper. - What?
- Who is she? - She is from legal.
And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit
- if you keep ogling her like that. - I need a new assistant, boss.
Yes, and I've got three excellent potential candidates.
They're lined up and ready to meet you.
I don't have time to meet. I need someone now.
I feel like it's her.
No, it's not.
- You ever boxed before? - I have, yes.
What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?
- How do I spell your name, Natalie? - R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
- What, are you gonna Google her now? - I thought I was ogling her.
- Wow. Very, very impressive individual. - You're so predictable, you know that?
She's fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin.
- Who speaks Latin? - No one speaks Latin.
- No one speaks Latin? - It's a dead language.
You can read Latin or you can write Latin,
- but you can't speak Latin... - Did you model in Tokyo?
- 'Cause she modeled in Tokyo. - Well...
I need her. She's got everything that I need.
Rule number one, never take your eye off your opponent.
Oh, my God!
- Happy! - That's what I'm talking about.
- I just slipped. - You did?
- Yeah. - Looks like a TKO to me.
Just... I need your impression.
You have a quiet reserve. I don't know, you have an old soul.
- I meant your fingerprint. - Right.
- So, how are we doing? - Great. Just wrapping up. Hey.
- You're the boss. - Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- No. - Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman.
Thank you very much.
- I want one. - No.
You know, it's Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes,
- just go with it. - Go with it? Go with what?
- Mr. Stark? - Hey.
Hello. How was your flight?
It was excellent. Boy, it's nice to see you.
We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don't mind. Okay?
- When did this happen? - What? You made me do it.
- I made you do what? - You quit. Smile. Look right there.
Stop acting constipated.
- Don't flare your nostrils. - You are so predictable.
- That's the amazing thing. - Right this way.
- You look fantastic. - Why, thank you very much.
But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?
You have a 9: 30 dinner.
- Perfect. I'll be there at 11: 00. - Absolutely.
- Is this us? - It can be.
- Great. Make it us. - Okay.
- Mr. Musk. How are you? - Hi, Pepper.
- Congratulations on the promotion. - Thank you very much.
Elon, how's it going? Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
Thank you. Yeah, I've got an idea for an electric jet.
- You do? - Yeah.
Then we'll make it work.
- You want a massage? - Oh, God. No,
- I don't want a massage. - I'll have Natalie make an...
- I don't want Natalie to do... - Don't want you tense.
By the way, I didn't mean to spring this on you.
Thank you very much.
- Green is not your best colour. - Oh, please.
Anthony! Is that you?
- My least favourite person on Earth. - Hey, pal.
- Justin Hammer. - How you doing?
You're not the only rich guy here with a fancy car.
You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair.
- You guys know each other? - Hi.
- Yes. - Yes.
- Yes, roughly. - We do.
BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.
- I know. I know. - Congratulations.
My editor will kill me if I don't grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
- Can I? - Sure.
She's actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair.
I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.
- Right. - Right?
Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
And she wrote a story as well.
- It was very impressive. - That was good.
- Very well done. - Thank you.
- I'm gonna go wash. - Don't leave me.
- Hey, buddy. How you doing? - I'm all right.
- Looking gorgeous. - Please, this is tough.
Can I ask you... Is this the first time...
Fromage.
- Say, "Brie." ...that you guys have seen each other?
God, that's so awful.
Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?
Since he got his contract revoked...
- Actually, it's on hold... when you were attempting to...
That's not what I heard. What's the difference between "hold"
- and "cancelled"? The truth? - Yes, what is?
No. The truth is... Why don't we put that away?
The truth is, I'm actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.
- Mr. Stark, your corner table is ready. - Yes?
I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.
- Hammer needs a slot, Christine. - We kid, yeah.
We kid. We're kidders.
Got any other bad ideas?
Tony!
Tony and I... Tony... I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We're not competitors.
Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities
for Hammer Industries, you know?
- Everything that Tony and I do... - Well, what's the use of having...
is a healthy... and owning a race car...
competition... if you don't drive it?
Is he driving?
Natalie. Natalie!
- Yes, Miss Potts? - Did you know about this?
This is the first that I have known of it.
This... This cannot happen.
Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
- Where's Happy? - He's waiting outside.
- Okay, get him. I need Happy. - Right away.
Tony's... You know, he...
We're not competitive. You know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know,
- can you excuse me just one second? - Just read me what you wrote.
- I will. I will, after. - Just read it back to me.
But I have to make one quick phone call.
- Where are you going? - This is great.
- I've got some caviar coming. - This is great stuff.
- I'll be right back. - Look!
That's Stark.
Go, go!
Hang on.
- Give me the case. - Here. Take it.
- Where's the key? - It's in my pocket.
Car!
Oh, my God!
- Are you okay? - Yeah.
- Were you heading for me or him? - I was trying to scare him.
- 'Cause I can't tell! - Are you out of your mind?
- Better security. - Get in the car right now!
I was attacked! We need better security.
- Get in the car! - You're CEO. Better security measures.
God, it's embarrassing.
First vacation in two years.
Oh, my God!
- I got him! - Hit him again. Hit him again.
Football.
- I got him! - Take the case! Take it!
- Take the case! - Give him the case!
Stop banging the car!
Calm down.
God! God!
Give me the case! Please! Come on!
You... You lose.
You lose. You lose, Stark.
Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low.
You could have doubled up your rotations.
You focused the repulsor energy through ionized plasma channels.
It's effective. Not very efficient.
But it's a passable knock-off.
I don't get it. A little fine tuning,
you could have made a solid paycheck.
You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran,
or gone right to the black market.
You look like you got friends in low places.
You come from a family of thieves and butchers.
And now, like all guilty men,
you try to rewrite your own history.
And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
My father. Anton Vanko.
Well, I never heard of him.
My father is the reason you're alive.
The reason I'm alive is 'cause you had a shot, you took it,
you missed.
Did I?
If you can make God bleed,
the people will cease to believe in him.
And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come.
The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch
as the world will consume you.
Where will you be watching the world consume me from?
That's right. A prison cell. I'll send you a bar of soap.
Hey, Tony. Before you go,
palladium in the chest, painful way to die.
It's just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle
and this man has no idea what he's doing.
He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy.
I was at a hearing where Mr. Stark, in fact, was adamant
that these suits can't exist anywhere else,
don't exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else,
at least for five to 10 years,
and here we are in Monaco realising, "These suits exist now."
Mute.
He should be giving me a medal. That's the truth.
- What is that? - This is your in-flight meal.
Did you just make that?
Yeah. Where do you think I've been for three hours?
Tony,
what are you not telling me?
I don't want to go home. At all.
Let's cancel my birthday party and...
We're in Europe. Let's go to Venice, Cipriani.
- Remember? - Oh, yes.
It's a great place to
- be healthy. - I don't think this is the right time.
We're in kind of a mess.
Yeah, but maybe that's why it's the best time.
- 'Cause then we... - Well, I think as the CEO,
I need to show up.
As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
- A leave? - A company retreat.
- A retreat? During a time like this? - Just a ride.
Well, I'm just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.
Hey, there he is.
There he is.
What an absolute pleasure. Welcome.
Oh, goodness gracious.
Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here?
Forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm such a huge fan of yours.
I didn't want to make a first impression like this.
He's not an animal. Come on.
He's a human being. Thank you.
We're fine.
My name is Justin Hammer.
I'd like to do some business with you. Please sit.
Dig in. What do we have today, Jack?
- We have some salmon carpaccio. - Salmon carpaccio.
Anything you want here, we got it.
I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco.
It's Italian, though.
Organic ice cream.
I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do, too, for Tony Stark.
What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track,
how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody,
that was... Wow!
You spoke to me with what you did.
And I know that you knew that I'd be listening.
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off
to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent.
But if I might make a suggestion,
you know, you don't just go and try and kill the guy.
I think, if I may, you go after his legacy.
That's what you kill.
You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways.
The only difference between you and I is that I have resources.
I think, if I may,
you need my resources.
Someone behind you, a benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.
Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator.
I don't know. Have you been understanding everything I'm saying?
Very good, man.
- Very good, man. - Very good, man.
Hey!
- Hey. - Yes?
I want my bird.
- A bird? You want a bird? - I want my bird.
I can get you a bird. I can get you 10 birds.
I want my bird.
Well, okay. Nothing's impossible. I could...
Are we talking about... Is this a bird back in Russia?
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong
- despite the events in Monaco. - Yes, of course.
- The AP wants a quote. - Don't tell him. Fax them...
Where is he?
- He doesn't want to be disturbed. - He's downstairs.
What happened in Monaco? - Yes, but...
But his continuing erratic behaviour
may lead many people to ask themselves,
"Can this man still protect us?"
Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
Query complete, sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist
who defected to the United States in 1963.
However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967.
His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,
was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium to Pakistan,
and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison.
No further records exist.
Tony, you gotta get upstairs
and get on top of this situation right now.
Listen. I've been on the phone with the National Guard all day,
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH,
knocking down your front door and taking these.
They're gonna take your suits, Tony, okay?
They're sick of the games.
You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years.
Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday.
It's not theoretical any more.
Are you listening to me?
- Are you okay? - Let's go.
Hey, man. Hey, hey!
- You all right? - Yeah, I should get to my desk.
- See that cigar box? - Yeah.
It's palladium.
Is that supposed to be smoking?
If you must know, it's neutron damage. It's from the reactor wall.
You had this in your body?
And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Road rash.
Thank you.
- What are you looking at? - I'm looking at you.
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act
and it's unnecessary. You don't have to do this alone.
You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do.
But you've gotta trust me.
Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I'm doing.
This is where we do it. This is my humble abode.
You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right?
No pressure.
Here they are. I'm very excited. They're combat-ready.
I may have done a few miscalculations
and rushed the prototype into production.
Sue me, I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.
You don't wanna do that.
You'll be able to access that
as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes.
Can we generate some encrypted pass codes?
Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack.
Never mind, I...
Wow. Okay. Good stuff.
- Sorry? - Software shit.
Well...
You're good.
You really blasted in past the firewall there.
Let me show you where you're gonna be working primarily.
Go ahead, take a look.
Get a good look at that. That's something, isn't it?
You know, those are really just for show and tell.
They're $125.7 million a pop, so... Wait! Oh, gosh.
Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here.
That's where the pilot goes.
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.
I'll take care of that, just leave it.
What you want them do?
Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years.
I want to make Iron Man look like an antique.
I wanna go to that Stark Expo,
I wanna take a dump in Tony's front yard.
You know what I'm talking about?
- I can do that. No problem. - Yeah?
Hey, fabulous! I love it.
Hey, this is our guy. Didn't I tell you? I had a feeling.
Do you know which watch you'd like to wear tonight, Mr. Stark?
I'll give them a look.
I should cancel the party.
- Probably. - Yeah.
- 'Cause it's... - Ill-timed.
Right, sends the wrong message.
Inappropriate.
Is that dirty enough for you?
Gold face, brown band. The Jaeger. I'll give that a look.
Bring them over here.
I'll take that. Why don't you...
I gotta say it. It's hard to get a read on you.
- Where are you from? - Legal.
Can I ask you a question, hypothetically?
Bit odd.
If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have,
how would you celebrate it?
I'd do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.
- Good evening. - Good evening.
Yes, sir, I understand.
No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I'll handle it.
Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours,
Iron Man will be back on watch.
Hey, Pepper.
I'm going to go get some air.
What's wrong?
- I don't know what to do. - You gotta be kidding me.
- That's it. I'm making... Pepper. - No, no, no. Don't call anyone.
This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
I know. I know. I get it.
I'm gonna handle it, okay? Just let me handle it.
Handle it. Or I'm gonna have to.
You know, the question I get asked most often is,
"Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?"
Just like that.
Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
I love you.
Unbelievable! Thank you so much.
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night.
And we're gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.
No, no, no, we can't... Wait, wait, wait.
We didn't have the cake. We didn't blow out the candles.
You're out of control, okay? Trust me on this one, okay?
- You're out of control, gorgeous. - It's time to go to bed. It's time.
- Give me another smooch. - You're not going to be
- happy about this. - Come on, you know you want to.
You just peed the suit.
- I know. It has a filtration system. - It's not sexy.
You could drink that water.
Just send everybody home, okay? It's time to...
- If you say so. - Okay.
I'll take this, you take that.
Pepper Potts.
She's right. The party's over.
Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago.
The after-party starts in 15 minutes.
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it, there's the door.
Yeah!
Hit!
Pull!
I think she wants the Gallagher!
I'm only gonna say this once.
Get out.
You don't deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
Goldstein.
Yes, Mr. Stark?
Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy's ass to.
I told you to shut it down.
Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.
Really?
Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.
Sidekick this!
Had enough?
- Natalie! - Miss Potts.
Don't you "Miss Potts" me! I'm on to you.
You know what? Ever since you came here...
Pepper!
Get out of here. Get out of here.
You want it? Take it!
Put your hand down.
You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
We don't have to do this, Tony.
You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
- Put it down! - You gonna take a shot?
- Put it down! - No!
- Drop it, Tony! - Take it.
Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes,
inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet...
Colonel.
Major.
Wow.
Yeah.
Let's take it inside.
Clear the area.
Sir!
I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
I told you I don't wanna join your super-secret boy band.
No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself.
- How's that working out for you? - It's... It's... It's...
I'm sorry. I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot.
Do I look at the patch or the eye?
Honestly, I'm a bit hung over.
I'm not sure if you're real or if I'm having...
I am very real.
I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet.
- Just my luck. Where's the staff here? - That's not looking so good.
I've been worse.
We've secured the perimeter,
but I don't think we should hold it for too much longer.
- You're fired. - That's not up to you.
Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
- Hi. - I'm a S.H.I.E.I.D. shadow.
Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
I suggest you apologise.
You've been very busy.
You made your girl your CEO, you're giving away all your stuff.
You let your friend fly away with your suit.
Now, if I didn't know better...
You don't know better. I didn't give it to him. He took it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it?
You're Iron Man and he just took it?
The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?
Is that possible?
Well, according to Mr. Stark's database security guidelines,
there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
- What do you want from me? - What do we want from you?
What do you want from me?
You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with.
Contrary to your belief, you are not the center of my universe.
I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.
Hit him.
Oh, God, are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?
Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds?
- What did she just do to me? - What did we just do for you?
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.
Give me a couple of boxes of that. I'll be right as rain.
It's not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.
Doesn't look like it's gonna be an easy fix.
Trust me, I know. I'm good at this stuff.
I've been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium.
I've tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
Well, I'm here to tell you, you haven't tried them all.
Hey, hey, hey. Special delivery.
Candygram.
I brought you something.
Oh, yeah.
We got you the bird, pal.
This is not my bird.
What do you mean? That's the bird. This is the bird.
Yeah. Pulled a lot of strings to get this bird.
This is a great bird.
- It's a beautiful bird. - We got this all the way from Russia.
Hey, man, this not my bird.
Well, listen, even if it's not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird.
I mean, you know, look, don't get so attached to things.
Learn to let go.
Wait a minute. Jack, what is that?
Is that... That's not a helmet. What is that?
Ivan... What's this? Jack.
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet to me.
How... How are you supposed to get a head in there?
- Jack, could you put your head in there? - No.
Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.
See, Ivan? He can't put his head in there.
That's... That's not a helmet. It's a head. I need to put a guy in there.
I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?
- Drone better. - What? Drone better?
Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
People make problem.
Trust me. Drone better.
Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird.
You said, "No problem."
That's what you said to me. You said, "No problem."
Now I need suits. The government wants suits.
Like Iron Man. You understand?
That's what the people want. That's what's gonna make them happy.
Hey, man.
Don't get too attached to things.
Learn to let go.
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.
You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.
Unbelievable.
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.
- It's functional? - Fully mission-capable.
Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponize it.
Sir?
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation at the Expo.
We'd like this to introduce it.
Sir, I don't believe that the Expo...
Colonel, the world needs to see this fast.
- We've got to make this happen. - Yes, General, but...
It's also an order.
Yes, sir.
Good work, Colonel. You've made your country proud.
Thank you, sir.
That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
No, it was finished.
It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my...
No. Howard said the arc reactor
was the stepping stone to something greater.
He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race.
He was on to something big,
something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a triple-A battery.
Just him, or was Anton Vanko in on this, too?
Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin.
Anton saw it as a way to get rich.
When your father found out, he had him deported.
When the Russians found out he couldn't deliver,
they shipped his ass off to Siberia
and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage.
Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in,
the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
You told me I hadn't tried everything.
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?
What haven't I tried?
He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge
to finish what he started.
He said that?
Are you that guy? Are you?
'Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
I don't know where you get your information,
but he wasn't my biggest fan.
What do you remember about your dad?
He was cold, he was calculating.
He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me,
so it's a little tough for me to digest
when you're telling me he said the whole future was riding on me
and he's passing it down. I don't get that.
You're talking about a guy whose happiest day
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
That's not true.
Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of S.H.I.E.I.D.
What?
- I got a 2: 00. - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- What's this? - Okay, you're good, right?
- No, I'm not good. - You got this? Right? Right?
Got what? I don't even know what I'm supposed to get.
Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact.
- You remember Agent Coulson, right? - Yeah.
And Tony,
remember, I got my eye on you.
We've disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world.
Good luck.
Please.
First thing, I need a little bodywork. I'll put in a little time at the lab.
If we could send one of your go on squad down to The Coffee Bean,
Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that'd be nice.
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorised by Director Fury
to use any means necessary to keep you on premises.
If you attempt to leave or play any games,
I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet.
- Okay? - I think I got it, yeah.
Enjoy your evening's entertainment.
Think this is the power source?
Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let's just focus on arming it, all right?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
Is it my birthday?
You got it. What did you do? What did you do?
- Is this what I think it is? - Yes, it is.
Hammer, I want to know what you're gonna do for us.
What am I going to do for you?
Well, the first thing I'm gonna do for you is I'm gonna upgrade your software.
- And then, second, I think I should... - That's not what I'm talking about.
I'm talking about firepower.
Well, you're talking to the right guy.
Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol.
Too downtown? I agree.
M24 shotgun, pump action.
Five-round magazine.
You know what? You're not a hunter.
What am I talking about? I'm getting rid of it.
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.
They do make something better than waffles.
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't disco enough for you,
so I'm gonna put it right here.
You're looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher.
Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control.
You're tough.
Let me tell you something. Size does matter.
Don't let anyone tell you different.
This is an M1347.62 Minigun.
Six individual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker.
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho,
or Puff the Magic Dragon.
Okay.
These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos.
This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle
with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine RDX burst.
It's capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted.
If it were any smarter, it would write a book.
A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon.
It would read it to you.
This is my Eiffel Tower.
This is my Rachmaninoff's Th ird. My Pietà.
It's completely elegant. It's bafflingly beautiful.
It's capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero.
I call it the Ex-Wife.
That's the best I got.
Are we gonna do this? Give me something here.
- You're like a sphinx. I can't read you. - I think I'll take it.
- Which one? - All of it.
All of it.
Everything is achievable through technology.
Better living, robust health
and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace.
I'm Howard Stark,
and everything you'll need for the future can be found right here.
City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of...
I'm Howard Stark,
and everything you'll need in the future can be found right here.
So, from all of us at Stark industries,
I would like to personally...
Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that?
Put that back. Put it back where you got it from.
Where's your mother? Maria?
Go on. Go, go, go, go.
All right, I think we got...
I'll... I'll... I'll come in and...
Are you waiting on me?
So, from all of us at Stark industries, I'd like to personally show you
my ass.
I'd like to... I can't... This is...
I can't... We have this, don't we?
This is a ridiculous way...
Everything
is achievable
through technology.
Tony?
You're too young to understand this right now,
so I thought I would put it on film for you.
I built this for you.
And someday you'll realise that it represents a whole lot more
than just people's inventions. It represents my life's work.
This is the key to the future.
I'm limited by the technology of my time, but one day you'll figure this out.
And when you do,
you will change the world.
What is and always will be my greatest creation
is you.
- $6. Six. - I don't have any dough.
- Here. - No, sir, that's too much.
No, it's fine. Take that.
- It's fine. - No, señor.
Take it. Take it. I don't like people handing me things.
If you just drop that there, that'd be great.
- Are you Iron Man? - Sometimes.
We believe in you.
It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
- Miss Potts? - Relax.
- Mr. Stark... - Is here.
- He refuses... - I don't. It's fine.
- I'll just be a second. - Listen, it's our position
that Stark has and continues to maintain
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.
When Mr. Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man,
- he was making a promise to America. - No, the suit belongs to us.
We trusted that he would look out for us.
- Yeah, but you're not... Burt... - He obviously did not.
- And now we learn that his secretary... - Yes, it does.
A woman named Virginia "Pepper" Potts,
has been appointed as CEO of Stark industries.
What are her qualifications?
- No. - Ms Potts is doing
nothing to manage this terrible...
- Mute. - No...
Burt... Burt... Burt, listen to me.
Don't tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country
and then not let me pursue this.
I'll get this stuff out of here.
Well, then, tell the President to sign an order.
We'll talk about it at the Expo.
Hammer's giving some presentation tomorrow evening.
- Will Tony Stark be there? - Will I?
- No, he will not. Bye. - I would like to be.
- Got a minute? - No.
Come on, you just got off the phone. You're fine, 30 seconds.
Twenty-nine. Twenty-eight.
I was just driving over here,
and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I'm not.
- You didn't come here to apologise? - Look, that goes without saying,
and I'm working on that.
But I haven't been entirely upfront with you,
and I just want to try to make good.
Can I move this? This is crazy.
It's like a Ferris wheel going.
- I'm trying to get some... - No.
Do you know how short life is?
And if I never got to express...
And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me.
And I don't care... I mean, I care. It would be nice.
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.
- I'm just gonna say it. - Let me stop you right here, okay?
Because if you say "I" one more time,
I'm gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think.
I am trying to run a company.
- Do you have any idea what that entails? - Yes.
People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you've disappeared,
and all I'm doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat for it.
I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do.
Did you bring me strawberries?
Did you know that there's only one thing on Earth that I'm allergic to?
Allergic to strawberries.
This is progress, Pepper.
I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
- I need you... - I need you, too.
To leave now. - That's what I'm trying to...
Ms Potts?
- Hi, come on in. - Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Thank you.
- Anything else, boss? - I'm good, Hap.
No, I'll be just... another minute.
I lost both the kids in the divorce.
No.
Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here at Stark Enterprises?
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?
I thought you two didn't get along.
- No. That's not so. - It's just me you don't care for.
- No? Nothing? - Actually, while you're here,
maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.
Absolutely.
I'm surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Boy, you're good.
You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it?
You just tear things... You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?
Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.
You're good.
Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame?
I need a manipulatable projection.
1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
How many buildings are there?
Am I to include the Belgian waffle stands?
That was rhetorical. Just show me.
What does that look like to you, Jarvis? Not unlike an atom.
In which case the nucleus would be here.
Highlight the unisphere.
- Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them. - What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?
I'm discovering... Correction.
I'm rediscovering a new element, I believe.
Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.
Parking lots, exits, entrances.
Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework.
Dad.
Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.
The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Thanks, Dad.
Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We're back in hardware mode.
- I heard you broke the perimeter. - Yeah.
That was, like, three years ago. Where you been?
- I was doing some stuff. - Yeah, well, me, too, and it worked.
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Coulson,
you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.
Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
What's this doing here?
That's it.
- Bring that to me. - You know what this is?
It's exactly what I need to make this work.
Lift the coil.
Go, go. Put your knees into it.
There you go. And...
Drop it. Drop it.
Perfectly level. I'm busy. What do you want?
Nothing. Goodbye. I've been reassigned.
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
- Fantastic. Land of Enchantment. - So I'm told.
- Secret stuff? - Something like that.
- Good luck. - Bye.
- Thanks. - We need you.
- Yeah, more than you know. - Not that much.
Initialising prismatic accelerator.
Approaching maximum power.
That was easy.
Congratulations, sir.
You have created a new element.
Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core.
I will begin running diagnostics.
Hey, Ivan.
I got Senator Stern here.
Thought we'd swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
The drone is not going to be ready.
Not ready? What do you mean?
I can make presentation, not demonstration.
What the hell is the difference?
Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Well, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.
What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.
- I can make salute. - You can make salute?
What do you mean, "make salute"?
What the hell does that mean, lvan? This is not what we agreed to, okay?
You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.
- Hey, man, everything will be okay. - This is not what I wanted.
Hey, there he is. It's the bird man.
Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I'm confused.
You said it wasn't, but now it looks like you're best of pals.
You love that bird, don't you? You know what?
Take the bird.
Hey!
Take his pillows, too. Both of them.
And his shoes. Take his shoes.
I took your stuff.
How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad?
Good. 'Cause that's how I feel!
We had a contract.
I saved your life
and you give me suits.
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.
I don't know if you're a genius or a fraud. I don't know what you are.
Something really, really great fell into my lap.
And if it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.
Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself.
And now your overpriced paperweights
are gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration.
Do you dig what I'm getting at here?
I don't know if you know this, but I don't speak Russian!
I'm gonna leave now.
I'm gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I'll even get laid.
You see these guys? They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate
the terms of our agreement.
And you're gonna make good on our arrangement
because if you don't,
you're gonna be exactly what you were when I found you,
a dead man.
You got that?
Maybe you can watch me on TV.
Dummy, you, can we clean up this mess? You're killing me.
- You know I don't... - Incoming call
with a blocked number, sir.
My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely.
Coulson. How's the Land of Enchantment?
Hey, Tony, how you doing?
- I double cycle. - You what?
You told me double cycle's more power. Good advice.
You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
You, too.
- Trace him. - Sir.
Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.
Jarvis, where is he?
Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
What your father did to my family over 40 years,
I will do to you in 40 minutes.
Sounds good. Let's get together and hash it out.
Tri-State area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
I hope you're ready.
Call trace incomplete.
- Sir... - You want to run some tests, run them.
And assemble the suit while you're at it. Put it together now.
- We are unclear as to the effects... - I don't want to hear it, Jarvis.
That tastes like coconut.
And metal.
Oh, wow, yeah!
I'll keep the car down here, all right?
Thank you, Happy.
Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
Yeah.
That's what I'm talking about. Thanks for coming.
Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long,
this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm's way,
but then the Iron Man arrived,
and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us.
Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach.
That's not fair. That's not right.
- And it's just too bad. - Oh, Lord.
Regardless, it was an impressive innovation,
one that grabbed headlines the world over.
Well, today, my friends,
the press is faced with quite a different problem.
They are about to run out of ink.
Get that out of here.
Ladies and gentlemen,
today I present to you
the new face of the United States military.
The Hammer drone.
Army!
Navy!
Air Force!
Marines!
Yeah!
That's a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you.
But as revolutionary as this technology is,
there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war.
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you
the very first prototype
in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit
and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
What?
For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for...
We got trouble.
Tony, there are civilians present.
I'm here on orders. Let's not do this right now.
Give them a wave.
Hey, all right. Yeah.
All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here.
You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
Listen, I think he's working with Vanko.
Vanko's alive?
Yeah.
Where is he?
- What? - Where's Vanko?
- Who? - Tell me.
What are you doing here, man?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Is that you? - No, I'm not doing that. That's not me.
I can't move. I'm locked up. I'm locked up!
Get out of here. Go! This whole system's been compromised.
Let's take it outside.
No. No!
- Jarvis, break in. I need to own him. - Yes, sir.
Tony, Tony, I'm locked on. I have target lock.
- On what? - On you.
Tony, on your six!
- What's going on? What's happening? - The software's been overridden.
What? What do you mean it's been overridden?
- What does that mean? - I think he slaved the drones.
That's impossible.
- Call the guards. - All the phones are down, sir.
Well, then call their... Call their cells.
Their cell phones are not working, either, sir.
He's locked us out of the mainframe.
Who's locked you out of the mainframe?
Please, please, go away. Go away.
- I've got this handled. - Have you now?
Yes, I do.
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up, this wouldn't be happening.
So please, now go away. Thank you.
Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here.
What?
You tell me who's behind this.
- Who's behind this? - Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
- Where is he? - He's at my facility.
- I need NYPD, please. - No, no, no!
- Command Central. - No, no, honey.
- Don't call the authorities. - Okay. Right away. Right away.
Step aside. Step aside.
Tell me everything you know. Go.
- How are we doing, Jarvis? - Remote reboot unsuccessful.
This way.
Nobody's answering the phone. What's going on?
Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
- I'm not taking you anywhere. - Fine. You want me to drive?
No, I'm driving. Get in the car.
Nice work, kid.
- You got multiples coming in on you. - Let's get this away from the Expo.
When we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter.
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.
- Watch the road. - I got it. I got it.
Listen, listen.
A pack just peeled off. They're headed back to the Expo.
Got it.
I'm closing on you.
Ordnance coming in hot, Tony. Watch it.
- Stay in the car. - I'm not staying in the car.
I said, stay in the car.
What are you wearing?
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.
You want to help? Keep the car running.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey. You can't come in here.
Hold on. Hey!
Each set of drones is communicating
- in its own unique language. - Well, choose one and focus on that.
Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian?
Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
We got it. We're on our way.
I got him!
- Rhodey, you still locked on? - Yeah.
Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We're about to get wet on this ride.
Wait, wait, wait!
He's gone.
I'm sorry, buddy. Had to thin out the herd.
What's your 20?
- What are you doing? - I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.
Tony!
Reboot complete.
You got your best friend back.
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff. - Well done with the new chest piece.
I am reading significantly higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Yes, for the moment, I'm not dying. Thank you.
What do you mean you're not dying? Did you just say you're dying?
Is that you? No, I'm not.
- Not any more. - What's going on?
I was going to tell you. I didn't want to alarm you.
You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
- You didn't let me. - Why didn't you tell me that?
I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming, Tony.
Looks like the fight's coming to you.
- Great. Pepper? - Are you okay now?
I am fine. Don't be mad.
- I will formally apologise... - I am mad!
When I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
- Fine. - We could have been in Venice.
Oh, please.
Rhodes?
Snap out of it, buddy. I need you.
They're coming. Come on, let's roll. Get up.
Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
You okay?
Yeah, thanks.
- Tony, look, I'm sorry, okay? - Don't be.
No. I should have trusted you more.
I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
No. It's your fault. I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Thank you. That's all I wanted to hear. Partner.
They're coming in hot, any second. What's the play?
Well, we want to take the high ground, okay?
So let's put the biggest gun up on that Ridge.
Got you.
- Where do you want to be? - Where are you going?
- What're you talking about? - I meant me.
You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
- Tony, don't be jealous. - No. It's subtle,
- all the bells and whistles. - Yeah.
- It's called being a badass. - Fine.
All right. You go up top. I'll draw them in.
Don't stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
Okay, you got a spot. Where's mine?
It's the kill box, Tony. Okay? This is where you go to die.
- See that? - Yeah, yeah, nice.
Rhodey?
Get down.
Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Yeah. Sorry, boss. I can only use it once. It's a one-off.
I told you that five minutes ago.
That's your guy here.
- Excuse me? - You're being placed under arrest.
- Are you kidding me? - Hands behind your back, sir.
I'm trying to help here.
I get it. I see what you're doing. You're trying to pin this on me, huh?
That's good. That's good.
You're starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition.
I like that. You think you're making a problem for me?
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again real soon.
When they get here, I think you should station them
at the South, east and both west exits.
We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.
Yeah. Are you coming with us?
No, I'm gonna stay till the park is clear.
Okay.
Heads up. You got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.
The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Good to be back.
This ain't gonna be good.
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
With the what?
- Hammer tech? - Yeah.
I got this.
Rhodes. I got an idea.
- You want to be a hero? - What?
I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
- This is your idea? - Yep.
I'm ready. I'm ready. Go, go, go!
Take it.
You lose.
All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here, man.
Pepper?
Oh, my God! I can't take this any more.
- You can't? - I can't take this.
- Look at me. - My body, literally,
cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself or wreck the whole company.
I think I did okay.
I quit. I'm resigning.
That's it.
What did you just say? You're done?
That's surprising. No, it's not surprising. I get it.
- You don't have to make any excuses. - I'm... I'm... I'm not making any excuses.
You actually were just making excuses.
- But you don't have to. - No, I wasn't making an excuse.
- I'm actually very justified. - Listen. Hey, hey.
- You deserve better. - Well...
You've taken such good care of me.
I've been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so...
Right?
- Thank you. - Yeah.
- Thank you for understanding. - Yeah, yeah. Let's talk clean-up.
I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.
Okay. What about the press?
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna seem...
- Well, with you it's like dog years. - I know.
I mean, it's like the Presidency...
Weird.
- No, it's not weird. - It's okay, right?
- Yeah. - Run that by me again.
I think it was weird.
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
- I had just quit, actually. - Yeah, so we're not...
You don't have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
- You should get lost. - I was here first. Get a roof.
- I thought you were out of one-liners. - That's the last one.
- You kicked ass back there, by the way. - Thank you. You, too.
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion,
so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?
Not okay. Not okay with that.
It wasn't a question.
How are you gonna resign if I don't accept?
I don't think I want you looking at that.
I'm not sure it pertains to you any more.
Now this, on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff's assessment of you.
Read it.
"Personality overview. Mr. Stark displays compulsive behaviour."
In my own defence, that was last week.
"Prone to self-destructive tendencies." I was dying.
I mean, please. And aren't we all?
"Textbook narcissism"?
Agreed.
Okay, here it is.
"Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes."
- I gotta think about it. - Read on.
"Tony Stark not...
"Not recommended"?
That doesn't make any sense.
How can you approve me but not approve me?
I got a new ticker.
I'm trying to do right by Pepper.
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.
Which leads us to believe at this juncture
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.
You can't afford me.
Then again, I will waive my customary retainer
in exchange for a small favour.
Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
I'll see what I can do.
It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards
to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr. Tony Stark,
who is, of course, a national treasure.
Thank you, Lieutenant Colonel,
for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.
- You deserve this. - Thank you, sir.
Mr. Stark.
Thank you for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.
You deserve this.
Oh, sorry.
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?
Let's get a photo.
Sir, we've found it.

TONY: A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that? What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter. I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh... (SIGHS)
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
('90s POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING)  Yo listen up here's a story
 About a little guy that lives in a blue world
 And all day and all night and everything he sees
 Is just blue like him inside and outside
 Blue is his house with a blue little window
 And a blue Corvette
 And everything is blue for him and himself
 And everybody around
 'Cause he ain't got nobody... 
(PEOPLE LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(HONKS) (CHUCKLING)
Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna... - Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man! HAPPY: - I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying. - Unintelligible.
- Really? - Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind. A winning combo.
- Where are we going? - Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room
because I also want to see your research.
Okay, you can see my research,
but that's... I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY) - Come here.
I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey. - Mr Stark.
(GREETS IN MANDARIN) - You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need a cardiologist after I...
(HONKING)
- Bye. - Perhaps another time?
TONY: It started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
(PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- The old days. KILLIAN: - Mr Stark!
TONY: I never thought they would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian. (STUTTERING) I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work? - Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,
my organisation's been tracking your research since year two of MIT.
TONY: Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it. He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh... - She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt. - Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
(WOMEN TALKING EXCITEDLY)
I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
- Yeah? - I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
TONY: Damn betcha.
Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain
- that governs repair... TONY: - Wow.
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic...
BOTH: ...operating system...
- ...of a living organism. - Exactly.
- Yes. - Wow.
Is that... Can you...
- What? - Can you not touch my plant?
It's not... She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others. Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy... - Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because... And, no, seriously, don't.
TONY: And you're starting with plants.
MAYA: For now, yeah. TONY: Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.
- Well, it's... BOTH: - Human application.
Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation. - It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention... - Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland. - Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things. - This week.
(CHUCKLES) You almost bought it, didn't you?
(EXPLOSION) (GLASS SHATTERING)
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
- The what? HAPPY: - Down!
Stay down! Stay down, boss.
- We're good. - Stay down.
You... You're... You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE COUNTING DOWN)
- What was that? MAYA: - It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it. Glitches happen.
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE CHEERING) - Hey! Happy New Year!
HAPPY: - Happy New Year. MAYA: - Happy New Year.
All right. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
HAPPY: - You good? - Yeah.
HAPPY: - I'll be right outside. - Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY: So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times. (DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soirée in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
TONY: - I'm different now. (TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven. TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
Which I will.
All right, let's do this. (SNIFFS)
DUM-E.
Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner? You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly 72 hours?
(WHOOSHING)
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite.
I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival
of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother.
Start tight and then go wide.
Stamp date and time.
Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test.
Initialise sequence.
(POWERING UP)
Jarvis, drop my needle.
(FUNKY CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING)  Dashing through the snow
 In a one horse open sleigh
 O'er the fields we go
 Laughing all the way
(GRUNTS)
 Bells on bob tails ring
Crap.
 Oh, what fun it is to sing
 A sleighing song tonight
(WHIRRING)
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
 Jingle all the way
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
(WHIRRING)
 In a one horse open sleigh 
(LAUGHS)
All right, I think we got this. Send them all.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(GRUNTS) (CLANGING)
Probably a little fast. Slow it down.
- Slow it down just a... (CRASHING)
...little bit.
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
(STRAINED) Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
(GRUNTS)
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
(RECORD SCRATCHES) (MUSIC STOPS)
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado, the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children, of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ems.
You continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people will soon know him
as the tron Patriot.
And how is President Ems responding?
By taking the guy they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit, but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups, all right?
(GRUFFLY) "I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.
Listen. "War Machine" was a little too aggressive.
All right? This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on? With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine. - The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing, nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help. Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech. I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING) I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind. (CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY: Yeah. Fine with me.
TONY: - What's your name? - Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it's not...
- it's not superhero business. - No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it. - It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
(EXHALES SHARPLY) - Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN: Are you okay, Mr Stark?
(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony. (INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you get out of the wormhole?
(GASPS) - Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say? RHODEY: Tony.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart. (STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me? (METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look. Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split. (GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement. They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use. - Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you. - What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start phasing it out immediately.
- What? - Excuse me, Bambi,
- you should be wearing... - Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes? - Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you. - Thank you.
- However... - I do appreciate it.
- ...since you've taken the post... - You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not... It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's trying to hide something.
- I... Yes. SECRETARY: - Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you. Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper.
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING) God, you look great.
I... I... I...
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good. - Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay. - Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay. - Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
(PHONES RINGING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's... That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though, wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a... It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me. (CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS) Oh, wait...
(RINGING CONTINUES) - Uh...
(CHIMES) - Hello?
TONY: - Is this Forehead of Security? - What?
You know, look... I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working. I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something. Do you know what happened
when I told people I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face. (TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job. I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real? - Yeah.
All right. So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome. - Right.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right? You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best. - Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials. I make him.
Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference? - Um...
- Switzerland. - Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No... I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember. He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine. They were tanking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird. He's showing her his big brain.
- His what? - Big brain.
And she likes it. Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen, and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you. Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen. Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more. You're not my boss.
All right? I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax. - Seriously?
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain? - Yeah.
There's a giant brain. There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know, if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy.
Yeah, I miss you, too. But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird. - Hey!
(STAMMERING) I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you? - Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R. who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible. - Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears, it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, Tony.
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM 13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed.
But then, as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep. - Hmm.
And I have no idea what it means.
No, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the... What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
TONY: Uh, yeah.
Something like that. You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
TONY: Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag
- at first, so... (CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually, it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay. - So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right? - Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING) Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit? - Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been (STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
PEPPER: - I'll take my chances. - That's risky.
(STRAINED) At least, let me get you
like, a hazmat suit you can... (GRUNTS)
- A Geiger counter or something like that. (STRAINING)
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame. - Sorry.
You ate without me already? On date night?
- He was just... - You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean we were just hosting you...
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)
- ...while I finished up a little work. - Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
- What? - What?
Aldrich Killian? What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me. - I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed. - Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while. I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same since New York.
Oh, really? I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things
and then they're over, and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know.
I tinker. I... (SIGHS)
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...
Machines.
They're part of me.
A distraction.
Maybe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.

Yes, I can regulate.

THE MANDARIN: True story about fortune cookies.
They look Chinese.
They sound Chinese.
But they're actually an American invention.
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff.
The Chinese Theatre.
Mr President,
I know this must be getting frustrating.
But this season of terror is drawing to a dose.
And don't worry,
- the big one is coming. (CHEERING)
Your graduation.
- Hi. - Oh!
(CHUCKLES) Do you mind leaving that on?
Sure.
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.
One more thing. Make sure everyone wears their badges.
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.
Plus, my guys won't let anyone in without them.
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...
His reaction to the latest attack.
(REPORTERS CLAMOURING) - Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?
MALE REPORTER: Hey, Mr Stark. When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward. So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here. It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon, it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man, here's my home address.
10880 Malibu Point.
90265.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?
(REPORTERS GASP)

JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir,
drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.
Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.
Okay. What have we got here?
The name is an ancient Chinese war mantle meaning "advisor to the king."
South American insurgency tactics.
Talks like a Baptist preacher.
There's lots of pageantry going on here. Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess of 3, 000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile radius of the Chinese Theatre?
No, sir.
Talk to me, Happy.
When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again.
Factor in 3,000 degrees.
The Oracle cloud has completed analysis.
Accessing satellites
and plotting the last 12 months of thermogenic occurrences now.
Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.
(SYSTEMS BUZZING)
Nope.
That. Are you sure that's not one of his?
It predates any known Mandarin attack.
The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Bring her around.
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3,000 degree Celsius.
That's two military guys.
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

Are we still at ding-dong?
- We're supposed to be on total... (BANGING ON TABLE)

There's only so much I can do, sir,
when you give the world's press your home address.
(DOOR BUZZES)
(UNLOCKS)
(SCANNER HUMS)
Right there is fine.
You're not the Mandarin.
Are you? Are you?
You don't remember. (CHUCKLES)
Why am I not surprised?
Don't take it personally. I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you, someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.
It's...
- With her. PEPPER: - Tony?
- Is somebody there? - Yeah,
- it's Maya Hansen. - Ah...
Old botanist pal
that I used to know, barely.
Please don't tell me there's a 12-year-old kid
waiting in the car that I've never met.
He's 13.
No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.
PEPPER: I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.
- We weren't. - And old girlfriends.
- She's not, really. - No, not really. I...
- it was just one night. TONY: - Yep.
That's how you did it, isn't it?
- It was a great night. PEPPER: - Yep. Well, you know.
- You saved yourself a world of pain. - What?
MAYA: - I'm sure. - Trust me. We're going out of town.
Okay. We've been through this.
- Nope. - Yep!
- The man says no. - Immediately and indefinitely.
TONY: - Honey... - Great idea. Let's go.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
This is how normal people behave.
TONY: I can't protect you out there.
Is... Is that normal?
- Sadly, that is very normal. - Yes, this is normal!
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!
Calm down.
- I got this for you. - I'm aware of that.
You still haven't even told me you liked it.
I don't like it.
I asked you three... You don't like it.
- We are leaving the house. MAYA: - Guys?
That's not even up for discussion.
- Can we, um... - I said no. What?
Do we need to worry about that?

That was selfish and stupid, and it won't happen again.
Also, it's Christmastime and the rabbit's too big.
Done. Sorry.

Oh, my God.
That...
That's... Is that Iron Man?
Technically, I am.
Technically, you're dead.
TONY: Valid point.
What happened to him?
Life.
I built him. I take care of him.
I'll fix him.
Like a mechanic?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" now.
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in, um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels? - To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode? - Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea. - Oops.
What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain. He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won, because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone,
the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name? - Who?
The kid that bullies you at school. What's his name?
How'd you know that?
I got just the thing.
This is a piñata for a cricket.
I'm kidding. This is a very powerful weapon.

What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.
So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...
That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder
running a team of 40 out of a privately funded think tank.
But sure, you can call me a botanist.

Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

HARLEY: What about the Avengers? Can we talk about them?
TONY: I dunno. Later. Hey, kid, give me a little space.
What's the official story here? What happened?
HARLEY: I guess this guy named Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right? - Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis. - Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell, on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that? - It's what everyone says.
You know what this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not... I don't care.
That giant Wormhole in, um, in New York.
Does it remind you?
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Are they coming back? The aliens?
Maybe. Can you stop?
Remember what I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Does this subject make you edgy?
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?
Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?
- Do you have medication? - No.
- Do you need to be on it? - Probably.
- Do you have PTSD? - I don't think so.
Are you going completely mental?
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

(GROANING)
(BRANDT SCREAMS)
(SCREAMING)
We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here!
Get her out! Get them out of here!
(GROWLING)
(ROARING)
A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire.
The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal?
It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you?
Sold it to the Mandarin.
Got you, pal.
MAYA: What happened?
MAYA: Fun fact.
Before he built rockets for the Nazis,
the idealistic Wernher von Braun
dreamed of space travel.
He stargazed. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London?
"The rocket performed perfectly."
"It just landed on the wrong planet."
See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science.
And then the ego steps in, the obsession.
And you look up,
you're a long way from shore.
You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya.
I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.
That's exactly what we used to do.
So, don't judge yourself.
Thank you, Pepper.
I really appreciate that.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
- Hi, good evening. Come on in. WAITER: - Good evening.
(GASPS) (GRUNTS)
Maya, run!
(WHIMPERS)
Hi, Pepper.
So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?
I'm trying to fix this thing.
I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.
(GROANS)
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark.
He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.
MAN: (ON RADIO) This is support team Blue-Zero.
Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Copy.
(REPULSOR FIRING) (PEOPLE SHRIEKING)
Nobody move.
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING IN FEAR)
Oh. Support Blue-Zero,
unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S.
involves cheaply-made sportswear,
I think you messed up again.
Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before.
It's... Of course.
Yes, ma'am.
Iron Patriot on the job.
Happy to help.
No need to thank me, ma'am.
It's my pleasure. (GRUNTING)
(GASPING)
Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
RHODEY: If you want this suit,
you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.
That's the plan, Colonel.
TONY: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?
- How much have you had? - Two or three bowls.
- Can you still see straight? - Sort of.
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis.
Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch,
and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry.
And, sir, you were right.
Once I factored in available AIM down/ink facilities
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa,
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,
but not right now.
Harley, where is he really?
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
Uh, it's not charging.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
What's questionable about electricity? All right?
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Oh, God, not again.
HARLEY: - Tony? (GASPING)
Are you having another attack?
I didn't even mention New York.
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
Okay, um, uh...
(PANTING)
God, what am I gonna do?
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.
You're a mechanic, right?
Right.
You said so.
Yes, I did.
Why don't you just build something?
Okay.
Thanks, kid.
(POWERING UP)

(SCREAMS) (DEVICE POWERS UP)
(CRACKLING) (GROANING)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTING)
Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.
(SCOFFS) My fault again.
Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con...

(THUDS)
(MIMICS GUNSHOT)
(CHUCKLES)
(BOTH GASP)
(TONY SHUSHING)
(TOILET FLUSHING)
MAN: (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Well.
I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. (LAUGHS)
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me. - Ah!
Nessie.
Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
There's some guy over here.
They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.
Hey!
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Don't move.
I'm not moving. You want something? Take it.
Although the guns are all fake
because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
- What? - Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
TONY: Heard enough.
You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy.
Where?
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here.
- He's here, but he's not here. - What do you mean?
It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.
- It is. - It's complicated.
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.
Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom.
Sit.
WOMAN 1: Ew! WOMAN 2: Oh, Jesus.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(GUNSHOT) (EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
TONY: What are you?
What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things, no two ways about it,
in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
- Next? - Then,
they approached me about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say? They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian? - Killian.
- He created you? - He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT) Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you. The costumes, green screen.
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything. - Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) Okay.
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
- No. - Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't. I'm on the street.
People are going bang. They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember? - I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule from behind the scenes.
Because the second you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment
the body is trying to decide whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.
(CLICKS) (HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great, but the last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.
(WHIRRING)
Afternoon, gentlemen.
(WHIRRING CEASES)
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
(LOW HUMMING)
(SIZZLING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
(GROANING)
(WATCH BEEPING)
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.
- I'm good like that. (BEEPING CONTINUES)
Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me? - You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
(RHODEY PANTING)
Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.
(BEEPING) - All right. Let's go.
(GRUNTING)
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand,
and the world's most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood
on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons. (SIGHING)
Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh! - Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.
- Three, four... - Shut up.
- Five, four, three, two, one! (GRUNTING)
- Told you. (GROANS)
(GROANING)
Where's the rest?
(RATTLING)
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)

(SCREAMING)
Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.
(GRUNTING)
Ah! Better late than never.
Not this time. Not the face.
Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
(BEEPING)
GUARD: All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
- Ah! Let's go! (THRUSTERS MISFIRING)
Aw, crap.
(GROANING)
(GRUNTING)
Tony?
Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours? - Uh... Mmm.
Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out! (GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners. (GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move, and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what? (SIZZLING)
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING) Olé, olé, olé, olé...
Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well.
Is that... Is that important?
- Somewhat. - Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right. (BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
- vice president thing, right? - Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY: Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out the president somehow.
We have to immediately alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel. - Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.
RHODEY: We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes. Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!
(SIZZLING)
(BEEPING)
Everything all right, Colonel?
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GROANING)
(SCREAMING)
(GASPS)
It is an honour, Mr President.
If you're gonna do it, do it!
Whoa! Cool your boots, sir.
That's not how the Mandarin works.
Sir, Air Force One has been compromised.
Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.
Image coming through now, sir.
Was that Rhodes?
(BANGING) MAN: - Is anyone there?
WOMAN: Let us out!
(GROANING)
(GRUNTS)
TONY: The President.
Now.
He's not here.

Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?

HEATHER: Oh, God! No! No!
TONY: Listen to me. See that guy?
I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him.
- You got it? - What? Oh!
(HEATHER RESUMES SCREAMING)
I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand.
We can do this, Heather.
(HEATHER WHIMPERING)
Easy, see? Eleven more to go.
(SCREAMING)
Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys?
That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey.
Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet.
(YELLING)
6,000 feet.
Come on, people.
Come on, come on, come on!
Yeah!
JARVIS: 1,000 feet.
400 feet.
200 feet, sir.
TONY: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him.
Hello.
(TONY STRAINING)
(PASSENGERS CHEERING)
MAN: We made it!
Nice work, guys!
Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us.
All right, Jarvis.
But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING) That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
The House Party protocol sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
Trophy.
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!
(MEN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
Come on.
You're not gonna freak out on me, right?
TONY: I hope not.
Oh, my God.
(SIGHS) He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Viking funeral. Public execution.
Yeah, death by oil.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) Broadcast will commence shortly.
Take final positions.
Okay. That's good.
Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
(TECHNICIAN TYPING)
Is your gun up?
Yep. What do I do?
Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.
Six, high, back. All right.
(GUNFIRE)
(BULLETS RICOCHETING)
You see that? Nailed it.
Yeah, you really killed the glass.
You think I was aiming for the bulb?
You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
ANNOUNCER: (ON PA) All personnel, we have hostiles
- on east unit 12. MAN: - Over there!
- I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12. - I'm out. Give me...
- You got extra magazines? - They're not universal, Tony.
I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
- One of yours. - I don't have one that fits that gun.
You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?
- What'd you see? - Too fast. Nothing.
Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)
(MEN GRUNTING)
Three guys, one girl, all armed.
God, I would kill for some armour right now.
- You're right. We need backup. - Yeah, a bunch.
You know what?
(WHOOSHING) RHODEY: - Is that...
Yep.
- Are those... - Yeah.
Merry Christmas, buddy.
TONY: Jarvis, target EXTREMIS heat signatures.
Disable with extreme prejudice.

What are you waiting for? It's Christmas.
Take them to church.

This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?
Everybody needs a hobby.
Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?
(GASPS)
TONY: Nice timing.
Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
What does that mean? I got you covered.
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
Very funny.
(GRUNTING)
(PANTING)
(BOTH SCREAM)
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
About time.
(GASPS) Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
You're such a jerk.
Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.
(METAL CREAKING) (SOBBING)
Come on. A little more, baby.
(PEPPER STRAINING)
(TONY GRUNTING) - Oh!
(GROANS)
Is this guy bothering you?
Don't get up.
Ooh.
Is it hot in there?
(SIZZLING)
Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck?
Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.
Oh, Tony.
(GRUNTS) - She's watching.
I think you should close your eyes.
Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.

Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there.
All right? You've got to let go.
You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise.

Well, here we are on the roof.
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.
I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.
Whatever.
You really didn't deserve her, Tony.
It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.
Here's where you're wrong.
She was already perfect.

Jarvis,
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
No...
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTING)
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
(SCOFFS)
(METAL CREAKING)
(GROANING)
No more false faces.
You said you wanted the Mandarin.
You're looking right at him.
It was always me, Tony. Right from the start.
I am the Mandarin!
(BREATHING HARD)
I got nothing.
(GRUNTING)
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage!
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)
(GROWLS)
What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?
(GRUNTING)
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Whoo!
(PANTING)
TONY: Honey?
Oh, my God.
That was really violent.
You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me. - Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you. - No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far? Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting. Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons. (REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh! (ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you... (METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour, it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off my chest,
and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know.
Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
(GASPS) - And the fact that you've been able to
- help me process... (CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me? - Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING) I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training. - So?
- I don't have the... - What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what? Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
- 1983, all right? - Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.

TONY: A famous man once said,
"We create our own demons."
Who said that? What does that even mean?
Doesn't matter. I said it because he said it.
So, now, he was famous
and it's basically getting said by two well-known guys.
I don't, uh... (SIGHS)
I'm going to start again.
Let's track this from the beginning.
('90s POP SONG PLAYING)
(SINGING)  Yo listen up here's a story
 About a little guy that lives in a blue world
 And all day and all night and everything he sees
 Is just blue like him inside and outside
 Blue is his house with a blue little window
 And a blue Corvette
 And everything is blue for him and himself
 And everybody around
 'Cause he ain't got nobody... 
(PEOPLE LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
(HONKS) (CHUCKLING)
Half hour till the ball drops.
- Hey, do you wanna... - Tony Stark?
- Great speech, man! HAPPY: - I got you, pal.
I gave a speech? How was it?
- Edifying. - Unintelligible.
- Really? - Mmm-hmm.
It's my favourite kind. A winning combo.
- Where are we going? - Uh, to town, on each other.
Probably back in your room
because I also want to see your research.
Okay, you can see my research,
but that's... I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Mr Stark.
Ho Yinsen.
Ah, I finally met a man called "Ho."
(CHUCKLES HUMOURLESSLY) - Come here.
I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr Wu.
- Oh, this guy. Hey. - Mr Stark.
(GREETS IN MANDARIN) - You're a heart doctor.
She's going to need a cardiologist after I...
(HONKING)
- Bye. - Perhaps another time?
TONY: It started in Bern, Switzerland. 1999.
(PEOPLE YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
- The old days. KILLIAN: - Mr Stark!
TONY: I never thought they would come back to bite me.
Why would they?
Oh, wow! Hey, Tony!
Aldrich Killian. (STUTTERING) I'm a big fan of your work.
- My work? - Who isn't? He means me.
Well, of course, but, Ms Hansen,
my organisation's been tracking your research since year two of MIT.
TONY: Yeah, we're full.
Oh, wow, he made it. He made the cut.
What floor you going to, pal?
Well, now, that is an appropriate question.
The ground floor, actually,
of a proposal I'm putting together myself.
It's a privately funded think tank called Advanced Idea Mechanics.
- Uh... - She'll take both.
One to throw away and one to not call.
"Advanced Idea Mechanics" or "AIM," for short. Do you get it?
- I see that, because it's on your T-shirt. - Aw!
Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Thank you, I'll call you.
(WOMEN TALKING EXCITEDLY)
I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
- Yeah? - I'll ditch these clowns.
I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.
Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.
You know what I'm talking about?
I'll see you up there.
TONY: Damn betcha.
Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Well, it was.
If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain
- that governs repair... TONY: - Wow.
MAYA: ...and chemically recode it.
That's incredible. Essentially, you're hacking into the genetic...
BOTH: ...operating system...
- ...of a living organism. - Exactly.
- Yes. - Wow.
Is that... Can you...
- What? - Can you not touch my plant?
It's not... She doesn't like it. She prefers...
She's not like the others. Come on. Let's go in the bedroom.
- Happy... - Hmm. That's cute...
Leave her ficus alone.
Because... And, no, seriously, don't.
TONY: And you're starting with plants.
MAYA: For now, yeah. TONY: Huh.
I'm calling it EXTREMIS.
- Well, it's... BOTH: - Human application.
Exactly, exactly.
- Dendritic revitalisation. - It's revolutionary.
- Disease prevention... - Change the world.
...even limb regrowth.
You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
Wow.
- In Switzerland. - Hmm. That's better.
- Aw, you're seeing things. - This week.
(CHUCKLES) You almost bought it, didn't you?
(EXPLOSION) (GLASS SHATTERING)
This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
- The what? HAPPY: - Down!
Stay down! Stay down, boss.
- We're good. - Stay down.
You... You're... You're right on me. I made it.
What the hell was that?
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE COUNTING DOWN)
- What was that? MAYA: - It's a glitch in my work. It's...
She was just talking about it. Glitches happen.
HAPPY: It's not Y2K.
(PEOPLE OUTSIDE CHEERING) - Hey! Happy New Year!
HAPPY: - Happy New Year. MAYA: - Happy New Year.
All right. I'll see you in the morning. Good night.
HAPPY: - You good? - Yeah.
HAPPY: - I'll be right outside. - Okay, cool.
(CHEERING CONTINUES)
TONY: So, why am I telling you this?
Because I had just created demons
and I didn't even know it.
- Yeah, those were good times. (DOOR CLOSES)
Then I moved on.
After a brief soirée in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene.
I forgot that night in Switzerland.
These days, I'm a changed man.
JARVIS: Forty-six.
TONY: - I'm different now. (TONY GROANS)
I'm... Well...
JARVIS: Forty-seven. TONY: You know who I am.
Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
No. Forty-eight.
(EXCLAIMS IN PAIN)
Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
As you wish, sir.
I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
Which I will.
All right, let's do this. (SNIFFS)
DUM-E.
Hi, DUM-E.
How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.
Hey. Hey!
What are you doing out of the corner? You know what you did.
Blood on my mat. Handle it.
Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly 72 hours?
(WHOOSHING)
Focus up, ladies.
Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite.
I am pleased to announce the imminent arrival
of your bouncing, bad-ass baby brother.
Start tight and then go wide.
Stamp date and time.
Mark 42. Autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test.
Initialise sequence.
(POWERING UP)
Jarvis, drop my needle.
(FUNKY CHRISTMAS MUSIC PLAYING)
(SINGING)  Dashing through the snow
 In a one horse open sleigh
 O'er the fields we go
 Laughing all the way
(GRUNTS)
 Bells on bob tails ring
Crap.
 Oh, what fun it is to sing
 A sleighing song tonight
(WHIRRING)
 Jingle bells, jingle bells
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
 Jingle all the way
 Oh, what fun it is to ride
(WHIRRING)
 In a one horse open sleigh 
(LAUGHS)
All right, I think we got this. Send them all.
(MUSIC CONTINUES)
(GRUNTS) (CLANGING)
Probably a little fast. Slow it down.
- Slow it down just a... (CRASHING)
...little bit.
(GROANS)
(GRUNTS)
(STRAINED) Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
(GRUNTS)
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
(RECORD SCRATCHES) (MUSIC STOPS)
Come on. I ain't scared of you.
I'm the best.
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.
TONY: I guess 72 hours is a long time between siestas.
I didn't think it could get any worse.
(GROANING SOFTLY)
Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
That's when he happened.
THE MANDARIN: Some people call me a terrorist.
(MAN YELLING INDISTINCTLY)
(GUNS FIRING)
I consider myself a teacher.
(CHEERING)
America.
Ready for another lesson?
In 1864, in Sand Creek, Colorado, the US military waited
until the friendly Cheyenne braves had all gone hunting.
Waited to attack and slaughter the families left behind
and claim their land.
39 hours ago,
the Ali AI Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked.
I... I... I did that.
A quaint military church
filled with wives and children, of course.
The soldiers were out on manoeuvres.
The braves were away.
President Ems.
You continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir.
And now you've missed me again.
(MEN YELLING)
(GUNS FIRING)
You know who I am.
You don't know where I am.
And you'll never see me coming.
PAT KIERNAN: Now that we seem to be back,
let's recap some of the frightening developments...
American airwaves were hijacked...
The nation remains on high alert.
All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful.
ELLIS: Central to my administration's response to this terrorist event
is a newly minted resource.
I know him as Colonel James Rhodes.
The American people will soon know him
as the tron Patriot.
And how is President Ems responding?
By taking the guy they call War Machine
and giving him a paint job.
The same suit, but painted red, white and blue.
Look at that. And they also renamed him, "Iron Patriot."
You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.
It tested well with focus groups, all right?
(GRUFFLY) "I am Iron Patriot!" It sucks.
Listen. "War Machine" was a little too aggressive.
All right? This sends a better message.
(SIGHS)
So, what's really going on? With the Mandarin.
Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
It's classified information, Tony.
Okay, there have been nine bombings.
- Nine. - The public only knows about three.
But here's the thing, nobody can ID a device.
There's no bomb casings.
You know I can help. Just ask.
I got a ton of new tech. I got a prehensile suit.
(STAMMERING) I got bomb disposal.
It catches explosions in mid-air.
When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did.
People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.
You're going to come at me like that?
No, look, I'm not trying to be a dick...
...tator.
Do you mind signing my drawing?
- If Richard doesn't mind. (CHUCKLES)
Are you all right with this, Dick?
RHODEY: Yeah. Fine with me.
TONY: - What's your name? - Erin.
I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
Listen, the Pentagon is scared.
After New York, aliens... Come on.
They need to look strong.
Stopping the Mandarin is a priority, but it's not...
- it's not superhero business. - No, it's not, quite frankly.
- I get it. - It's American business.
That's why I said I got it.
(EXHALES SHARPLY) - Are you okay?
I broke the crayon.
ERIN: Are you okay, Mr Stark?
(MUFFLED) Take it easy. Tony. (INHALES SHARPLY)
(WHISPERING) How did you get out of the wormhole?
(GASPS) - Wait a minute. Tony!
TONY: What did you say? RHODEY: Tony.
(GRUNTS) Sorry.
(BREATHLESSLY) I'm just checking on the suit.
(MECHANICAL WHIRRING)
Okay.
(PANTING)
(GASPING)
Check the heart. (STAMMERING)
Is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac anomaly or unusual brain activity.
Okay, so I was poisoned?
My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
- Me? (METALLIC CLINKING)
Come on, man, this isn't a good look. Open up.
TONY: Sorry, I gotta split. (GRUNTS)
(CROWD GASPS IN AWE)
HAPPY: Badge.
- Badge. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Come on, badge.
Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet. Come on.
Tony has got them in his basement. They're wearing party hats.
- This is an asset that we can put to use. - Uh-huh.
So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots.
- Thank you. - What I'm saying is that
the human element of human resources is our biggest point of vulnerability.
We should start phasing it out immediately.
- What? - Excuse me, Bambi,
- you should be wearing... - Did you just say that?
- Security? Yes? - Happy? Okay.
I am thrilled that you are now the Head of Security. Okay?
- It is the perfect position for you. - Thank you.
- However... - I do appreciate it.
- ...since you've taken the post... - You don't have to thank me.
...we've had a rise in staff complaints of 300%.
Thank you.
It's not a compliment.
It's not... It is a compliment.
Clearly, somebody's trying to hide something.
- I... Yes. SECRETARY: - Excuse me.
Ms Potts, your 4:00 is here.
- Thank you. Did you clear this 4:00 with me?
Happy, we'll talk about this later,
but right now, I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.
How so?
I used to work with him and he used to ask me out all the time,
so it's a little awkward.
I don't like the sound of that.
Pepper.
Killian?
You look great.
You look really great.
PEPPER: (STAMMERING) God, you look great.
I... I... I...
What on earth have you been doing?
Nothing fancy.
Just five years in the hands of physical therapists.
And please, call me Aldrich.
Uh, you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
- Happy, it's okay. We're good. - Yes.
- Are you sure? Okay. - Yes. Stand down.
- I'm going to linger right here. Okay. - Thank you.
It's very nice to see you, Killian.
(PHONES RINGING)
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Hey, guy.
Merry Christmas.
KILLIAN: After years dodging the President's ban
on "immoral" biotech research,
my think tank
now has a little something in the pipeline.
It's an idea we like to call EXTREMIS.
I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Regard the human brain.
(HUMMING)
Uh... Wait, hold on, hold on.
That's... That's the universe. My bad.
But if I do that...
That's the brain.
Strangely mimetic, though, wouldn't you say?
Wow, that's amazing.
Thanks, it's mine.
What?
This. You're inside my head.
It's a... It's a live feed.
Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Come on.
Now, pinch my arm.
- I can take it. Pinch me. (CHUCKLES)
(GASPS) What is that?
It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain centre.
But this is what I wanted to show you.
(BEEPS)
Now, EXTREMIS harnesses our bioelectrical potential
and it goes here.
This is essentially an empty slot and what this tells us
is that our mind,
our entire DNA, in fact,
is destined to be upgraded.
Wow.
(QUIET RINGING)
(WHISPERS) Oh, wait...
(RINGING CONTINUES) - Uh...
(CHIMES) - Hello?
TONY: - Is this Forehead of Security? - What?
You know, look... I got a real job. What do you want?
I'm working. I've got something going on, here.
What, harassing interns?
Let me tell you something. Do you know what happened
when I told people I was Iron Man's bodyguard?
- They would laugh in my face. (TONY CHUCKLES)
I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity.
Now I got a real job. I'm watching Pepper.
What's going on? Fill me in.
- For real? - Yeah.
All right. So, she's meeting up with this scientist.
- Rich guy. Handsome. - Right.
I couldn't make his face, at first. Right? You know I'm good with faces.
- Oh, yeah, you're the best. - Yeah.
Well, so I run his credentials. I make him.
Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in...
Where were we in '99?
- The science conference? - Um...
- Switzerland. - Right, right, exactly.
Killian. No... I don't remember that guy.
Of course you don't remember. He's not a blond with a big rack.
At first, it was fine. They were tanking business.
But now it's, like, getting weird. He's showing her his big brain.
- His what? - Big brain.
And she likes it. Here, let me show you.
Hold on. See?
Look at what? You, watching them?
Flip the screen, and then we can get started.
I'm not a tech genius like you. Just trust me. Get down here.
Flip the screen. Then I can see what they're doing.
I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen!
Don't talk to me like that any more. You're not my boss.
All right? I don't work for you.
And I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him.
He's shifty.
- Relax. - Seriously?
I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter.
Tell them to go out for a drink or something.
You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here.
This woman's the best thing that ever happened to you
and you're just ignoring her.
- A giant brain? - Yeah.
There's a giant brain. There's a shifty character.
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and I'm gonna...
You know, if it gets rough, so be it.
I miss you, Happy.
Yeah, I miss you, too. But the way it used to be.
Now you're off with the super-friends.
I don't know what's going on with you any more.
- The world's getting weird. - Hey!
(STAMMERING) I hate to cut you off.
- Do you have your Taser on you? - Why?
I think there's a gal in H.R. who's trying to steal some printer ink.
You should probably go over there and zap her.
Yeah, nice.
Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism
and recode its DNA.
- That would be incredible. - Hmm.
Unfortunately, to my ears, it also sounds highly weaponisable.
As in, enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is...
Tony, Tony.
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM 13 years ago.
He turned me down.
But something tells me now there's a new genius on the throne
who doesn't have to answer to Tony any more
and who has slightly less of an ego.
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.
As much as I'd like to help you.
Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed.
But then, as my father used to say,
"Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph."
- That's very deep. - Hmm.
And I have no idea what it means.
No, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
(CHUCKLES)
I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
(INHALES SHARPLY) Happy.
Car's ready, if you're ready to go.
Yes, I just, um...
God, I forgot my other things, so...
I'm just gonna...
(CAMERA CLICKS)
(SIGHS)
I'm sorry I'm late. I was...
What the... What is that?
You're wearing this in the house now?
What is that, like, Mark 15?
TONY: Uh, yeah.
Something like that. You know, everybody needs a hobby.
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
TONY: Just breaking it in.
You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag
- at first, so... (CHUCKLES)
Well, hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Yes, I did. I...
I don't know how I could've missed that Christmas present.
Is it gonna fit through the door?
TONY: Well, actually, it's a good question.
I got a team of guys coming tomorrow. They're gonna blow out that wall.
- Okay. - So, uh...
Tense? Good day? Huh?
Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl.
I don't want to harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Did I like it?
- Nailed it, right? - Wow.
I appreciate the thought very much.
So, why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
(IMITATING COMPUTER BEEPING) Huh...
Yep. Damn it, no can do.
You want to just kiss it on the...
- The facial slit? - Uh-huh.
Well, why don't I run down to the garage
and see if I can't find a crowbar to jimmy that thing open?
Crowbar, yeah.
Oh! Except there's been (STAMMERING) a radiation leak.
PEPPER: - I'll take my chances. - That's risky.
(STRAINED) At least, let me get you
like, a hazmat suit you can... (GRUNTS)
- A Geiger counter or something like that. (STRAINING)
Busted.
- This is a new level of lame. - Sorry.
You ate without me already? On date night?
- He was just... - You mean you.
Well, yeah, I just mean we were just hosting you...
(SCOFFS IN DISBELIEF)
- ...while I finished up a little work. - Uh-huh.
And yes, I had a quick bite.
I didn't know if you were coming home
or you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
- What? - What?
Aldrich Killian? What, are you checking up on me?
Happy was concerned.
- No, you're spying on me. - I wasn't.
- I'm going to bed. - Hold on.
Come on. Pep?
Hey, I admit it.
My fault. Sorry.
I'm a piping hot mess.
It's been going on for a while. I haven't said anything.
Nothing's been the same since New York.
Oh, really? I didn't notice that at all.
You experience things
and then they're over, and you still can't explain them.
Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I'm just a man in a can.
The only reason I haven't cracked up
is probably because you moved in.
Which is great.
I love you. I'm lucky.
But honey, I can't sleep.
You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know.
I tinker. I... (SIGHS)
Threat is imminent.
And I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without.
That's you.
And my suits, they're, uh...
Machines.
They're part of me.
A distraction.
Maybe.
I'm gonna take a shower.
Okay.
And you're gonna join me.
Better.

TONY: I must have called it in my sleep.
That's not supposed to happen.
I'll recalibrate the sensors.
Can we just... Just let me...
Just let me catch my breath. Hey, don't... Don't go. All right? Pepper...
I'm going to sleep downstairs.
Tinker with that.
(PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Can you regulate?
Yes, I can regulate.
- You sure about that? - Yes.
- It's a decent batch. (CHUCKLES)
- Don't say I never did nothing for you. - Thank you.
I mean, for understanding.
HAPPY: I'm sorry, buddy.

What are you doing, buddy?
You out by yourself? A little date night?
Seeing your favourite chick flick, maybe?
Yeah, a little movie called The Party's Over,

Here's the ticket.
No kidding. That doesn't belong to you.

THE MANDARIN: True story about fortune cookies.
They look Chinese.
They sound Chinese.
But they're actually an American invention.
Which is why they're hollow, full of lies
and leave a bad taste in the mouth.
My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knockoff.
The Chinese Theatre.
Mr President,
I know this must be getting frustrating.
But this season of terror is drawing to a dose.
And don't worry,
- the big one is coming. (CHEERING)
Your graduation.
- Hi. - Oh!
(CHUCKLES) Do you mind leaving that on?
Sure.
Sunday nights. PBS. Downton Abbey.
That's his show. He thinks it's elegant.
One more thing. Make sure everyone wears their badges.
He's a stickler for that sort of thing.
Plus, my guys won't let anyone in without them.
We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark.
We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...
His reaction to the latest attack.
(REPORTERS CLAMOURING) - Mr Stark, hi there.
Our sources are telling us that all signs are pointing to another Mandarin attack.
Anything else you can tell us?
MALE REPORTER: Hey, Mr Stark. When is somebody gonna kill this guy?
I'm just saying.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)
Is that what you want?
Here's a little holiday greeting
I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin.
I just didn't know how to phrase it until now.
My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you.
I know you're a coward. So I've decided
that you just died, pal.
I'm gonna come get the body.
There's no politics here. It's just good old-fashioned revenge.
There's no Pentagon, it's just you and me.
And on the off chance you're a man, here's my home address.
10880 Malibu Point.
90265.
I'll leave the door unlocked.
That's what you wanted, right?
(REPORTERS GASP)
- Bill me. (REPORTERS CLAMOURING)
JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir,
drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., FBI and CIA intercepts.
Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.
Okay. What have we got here?
The name is an ancient Chinese war mantle meaning "advisor to the king."
South American insurgency tactics.
Talks like a Baptist preacher.
There's lots of pageantry going on here. Lots of theatre. Close.
The heat from the blast was in excess of 3, 000 degrees Celsius.
Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporised instantly.
No bomb parts found in a three-mile radius of the Chinese Theatre?
No, sir.
Talk to me, Happy.
When is a bomb not a bomb?
Any military victims?
Not according to public record, sir.
Bring up the thermogenic signatures again.
Factor in 3,000 degrees.
The Oracle cloud has completed analysis.
Accessing satellites
and plotting the last 12 months of thermogenic occurrences now.
Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.
(SYSTEMS BUZZING)
Nope.
That. Are you sure that's not one of his?
It predates any known Mandarin attack.
The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Bring her around.
The heat signature is remarkably similar.
3,000 degree Celsius.
That's two military guys.
Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.
(DOORBELL RINGS)
Are we still at ding-dong?
- We're supposed to be on total... (BANGING ON TABLE)

Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?
There's only so much I can do, sir,
when you give the world's press your home address.
(DOOR BUZZES)
(UNLOCKS)
(SCANNER HUMS)
Right there is fine.
You're not the Mandarin.
Are you? Are you?
You don't remember. (CHUCKLES)
Why am I not surprised?
Don't take it personally. I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
That's right.
Okay, look, I need to be alone with you, someplace not here.
It's urgent.
Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.
It's...
- With her. PEPPER: - Tony?
- Is somebody there? - Yeah,
- it's Maya Hansen. - Ah...
Old botanist pal
that I used to know, barely.
Please don't tell me there's a 12-year-old kid
waiting in the car that I've never met.
He's 13.
No, I need your help.
But, what for? Why now?
Because I read the papers and frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.
I'll be fine.
PEPPER: I'm sorry, with Happy in the hospital,
I didn't know we were expecting guests.
- We weren't. - And old girlfriends.
- She's not, really. - No, not really. I...
- it was just one night. TONY: - Yep.
That's how you did it, isn't it?
- It was a great night. PEPPER: - Yep. Well, you know.
- You saved yourself a world of pain. - What?
MAYA: - I'm sure. - Trust me. We're going out of town.
Okay. We've been through this.
- Nope. - Yep!
- The man says no. - Immediately and indefinitely.
TONY: - Honey... - Great idea. Let's go.
I'm sorry, that's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
This is how normal people behave.
TONY: I can't protect you out there.
Is... Is that normal?
- Sadly, that is very normal. - Yes, this is normal!
It's a big bunny. Relax about it!
Calm down.
- I got this for you. - I'm aware of that.
You still haven't even told me you liked it.
I don't like it.
I asked you three... You don't like it.
- We are leaving the house. MAYA: - Guys?
That's not even up for discussion.
- Can we, um... - I said no. What?
Do we need to worry about that?

I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time.
So... First off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way.
That was selfish and stupid, and it won't happen again.
Also, it's Christmastime and the rabbit's too big.
Done. Sorry.
And I'm sorry in advance
because I can't come home yet.
I need to find this guy.

(GASPS IN AWE) (GUN CLATTERS)
Oh, my God.
That...
That's... Is that Iron Man?
Technically, I am.
Technically, you're dead.
TONY: Valid point.
What happened to him?
Life.
I built him. I take care of him.
I'll fix him.
Like a mechanic?
Yeah.
Hmm.
If I was building Iron Man and War Machine...
It's "Iron Patriot" now.
That's way cooler.
No, it's not.
Anyways, I would have added in, um, the retro...
- Retro-reflective panels? - To make him stealth mode.
- You want a stealth mode? - Cool, right?
That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
- Not a good idea. - Oops.
What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger?
He's in pain. He's been injured. Leave him alone.
Sorry.
Are you?
Don't worry about it, I'll fix it.
So, uh, who's home?
Well, my mom already left for the diner and Dad went to 7-11 to get scratchers.
I guess he won, because that was six years ago.
Hmm.
Which happens. Dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it.
Here's what I need.
A laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone,
the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there,
a map of town, a big spring and a tuna fish sandwich.
What's in it for me?
- Salvation. What's his name? - Who?
The kid that bullies you at school. What's his name?
How'd you know that?
I got just the thing.
This is a piñata for a cricket.
I'm kidding. This is a very powerful weapon.
Point it away from your face, press the button on top,

PEPPER: Why were you at the house tonight?
What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin.
So, if you still want to talk about it
I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.
Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think?
But Tony says you're a botanist. So...
That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder
running a team of 40 out of a privately funded think tank.
But sure, you can call me a botanist.
This boss of yours, does he have a name?
Yeah, Aldrich Killian.

HARLEY: What about the Avengers? Can we talk about them?
TONY: I dunno. Later. Hey, kid, give me a little space.
What's the official story here? What happened?
HARLEY: I guess this guy named Chad Davis used to live roundabouts.
He won a bunch of medals in the army.
And one day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb.
Then he blew himself up, right here.
- Six people died, right? - Yeah.
- Including Chad Davis. - Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. That doesn't make sense.
Think about it.
Six dead. Only five shadows.
Yeah.
People said these shadows are like the marks of souls going to heaven.
Except the bomb guy.
He went to hell, on account of he didn't get a shadow.
That's why there's only five.
- Do you buy that? - It's what everyone says.
You know what this crater reminds me of?
No idea. I'm not... I don't care.
That giant Wormhole in, um, in New York.
Does it remind you?
That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Are they coming back? The aliens?
Maybe. Can you stop?
Remember what I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Does this subject make you edgy?
Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Are there bad guys in Rose Hill?
Do you need a plastic bag to breathe into?
- Do you have medication? - No.
- Do you need to be on it? - Probably.
- Do you have PTSD? - I don't think so.
Are you going completely mental?
I can stop. Do you want me to stop?

You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya.
I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.
Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.
That's exactly what we used to do.
So, don't judge yourself.
Thank you, Pepper.
I really appreciate that.
(KNOCK ON DOOR)
(DOOR OPENS)
- Hi, good evening. Come on in. WAITER: - Good evening.
(GASPS) (GRUNTS)
Maya, run!
(WHIMPERS)
Hi, Pepper.
So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?
I'm trying to fix this thing.
I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?
I've told you, Killian, we can use him.
(GROANS)
Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark.
He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.
MAN: (ON RADIO) This is support team Blue-Zero.
Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Copy.
(REPULSOR FIRING) (PEOPLE SHRIEKING)
Nobody move.
(WOMEN EXCLAIMING IN FEAR)
Oh. Support Blue-Zero,
unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S.
involves cheaply-made sportswear,
I think you messed up again.
Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before.
It's... Of course.
Yes, ma'am.
Iron Patriot on the job.
Happy to help.
No need to thank me, ma'am.
It's my pleasure. (GRUNTING)
(GASPING)
Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
RHODEY: If you want this suit,
you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.
That's the plan, Colonel.
TONY: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?
- How much have you had? - Two or three bowls.
- Can you still see straight? - Sort of.
That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis.
Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch,
and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry.
And, sir, you were right.
Once I factored in available AIM down/ink facilities
I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa,
Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through
rebooting Jarvis's speech drive,
but not right now.
Harley, where is he really?
Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
Uh, it's not charging.
(TYRES SCREECHING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable.
It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
What's questionable about electricity? All right?
It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... (BREATHING HEAVILY)
Oh, God, not again.
HARLEY: - Tony? (GASPING)
Are you having another attack?
I didn't even mention New York.
Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
Okay, um, uh...
(PANTING)
God, what am I gonna do?
Just breathe. Really, just breathe.
You're a mechanic, right?
Right.
You said so.
Yes, I did.
Why don't you just build something?
Okay.
Thanks, kid.

I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. (LAUGHS)
Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
- That's me. - Ah!
Nessie.
Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
There's some guy over here.
They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.
Hey!
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Don't move.
I'm not moving. You want something? Take it.
Although the guns are all fake
because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
- What? - Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
TONY: Heard enough.
You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy.
Where?
Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here.
- He's here, but he's not here. - What do you mean?
It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.
- It is. - It's complicated.
Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out.
Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom.
Sit.
WOMAN 1: Ew! WOMAN 2: Oh, Jesus.
(DOOR CLOSES)
(GUNSHOT) (EXCLAIMS IN FEAR)
My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
TONY: What are you?
What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.
Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.
You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances.
And I ended up doing things, no two ways about it,
in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
- Next? - Then,
they approached me about the role,
and they knew about the drugs.
What did they say? They'd get you off them?
They said they'd give me more.
They gave me things.
They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery.
They gave me things.
(SNORING)
Did you just nod off?
Hey.
No, and a lovely speedboat.
And the thing was, he needed someone
to take credit for some accidental explosions.
(MIMICS EXPLOSION)
"He"?
- Killian? - Killian.
- He created you? - He created me.
Custom-made terror threat.
Yes. Yes.
His think tank thinked it up.
The pathology of a serial killer.
The manipulation of Western iconography.
(WITHOUT ACCENT) Ready for another lesson?
Blah, blah, blah.
No.
(WITH ACCENT) Of course, it was my performance
that brought the Mandarin to life.
Your performance?
Where people died?
No, they didn't.
Look around you. The costumes, green screen.
Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff.
And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma
and he might not wake up.
So you're gonna have to answer for that.
You're still going down, pal.
You under...
(GRUNTS)
Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
- I didn't tell him anything. - Nothing?
No.
You should have pressed the panic button.
Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
(TYPING)
TONY: Ah...
(SIGHS) Okay.
It's just like old times, huh?
Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
It wasn't my idea.
Okay. So you took Killian's card.
I took his money.
And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
- No. - Yeah.
No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
Yeah?
(SIGHS)
A lot has happened, Tony.
But I'm close.
EXTREMIS is practically stabilised.
I'm telling you it isn't. I'm on the street.
People are going bang. They're painting the walls.
Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Then help me fix it.
Did I do that?
Yes.
I remember the night, not the morning.
Is this what you've been chasing around?
- You don't remember? - I can't help you.
You used to have a moral psychology.
You used to have ideals.
You wanted to help people.
Now look at you.
I get to wake up every morning with someone who
still has their soul.
Get me out of here.
Come on.
KILLIAN: You know what my old man used to say to me?
One of his favourite of many sayings...
"The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
How can I be pissed at you, Tony?
I'm here to thank you.
You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me.
Desperation.
If you think back to Switzerland,
you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right?
Well, for the first 20 minutes,
I actually thought you'd show up.
And the next hour...
I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby.
If you know what I mean.
Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
But as I looked out over that city,
nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me,
no one was even looking.
I had a thought that would guide me for years to come.
Anonymity, Tony.
Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since.
Right?
You simply rule from behind the scenes.
Because the second you give evil a face,
a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin,
you hand the people a target.
You're something else.
You have met him, I assume?
Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
I know he's a little over the top sometimes.
It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden...
He's a stage actor.
They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is.
Anyway, the point is,
ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky,
subtlety has kind of had its day.
What's next for you in your world?
Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift
that you so graciously imparted to me.
(ORBS HUMMING)
Desperation.
Now, this is live.
I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment
the body is trying to decide whether to accept EXTREMIS
or just give up.
And if it gives up,
I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular.
But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain.
(CLICKS) (HUMMING CEASES)
We haven't even talked salary yet.
What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
MAYA: Let him go.
Hold on, hold on.
Maya...
I said, let him go.
What are you doing?
1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat.
Maya, give me the injector.
If I die, Killian,
what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?
We're not doing this, okay?
What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?
(BREATHING DEEPLY)
KILLIAN: The good news is,
a high-level position has just been vacated.
(GROANS)
(SIGHS)
You are a maniac.
No, I'm a visionary.
But I do own a maniac.
And he takes the stage tonight.
Once we get the Patriot installed,
it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Well, that's great, but the last time I looked
there was somebody inside of it.
(WHIRRING)
Afternoon, gentlemen.
(WHIRRING CEASES)
Hello, Colonel.
Step aside.
(LOW HUMMING)
(SIZZLING)
(INHALES DEEPLY)
Oh!
We'll get you out of there.
Don't worry.
You'll damage the armour.
Yes, I will.
But you can fix it, right?
I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp.
And I want Potts with me.
She's still in Phase Two.
You're not going deaf, are you?
(GROANING)
(WATCH BEEPING)
Careful, there. It's a limited edition.
Hey, uh, Ponytail Express.
What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
832 miles.
Very nice.

Can you, uh, stop that?
Break it, you bought it.
I think I bought it.
Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister.
And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
- What are you gonna do to me? - You'll see.
You're zip-tied to a bed.
This.
That.
Are you coming out?
(RHODEY PANTING)
Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.
(BEEPING) - All right. Let's go.
(GRUNTING)
You... You breathe fire? Okay.
(GROWLING)
(GRUNTING)
It's a glorious day, Savin.
This time tomorrow,
I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand,
and the world's most feared terrorist in the other.
I'll own the war on terror.
Create supply and demand.
For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood
on the ground in five, four, three...
Come on! Two...
How did we get this shift?
All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape.
- Put down your weapons. (SIGHING)
Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live.
In five, four, bang!
- Ooh! - Wow. That was...
You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
I am just beyond terrified.
Here it comes.

Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
- No. You got yours? - Uh... Mmm.
Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can.
There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
(SNORING)
- You, you, you! Move! Get out! (GIRLS WHIMPERING)
The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
- What's this? I had winners. (GUNSHOTS)
What have you come as?
You make a move, and I break your face.
I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
This is the Mandarin?
Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that.
But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me,
there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
- Doing what? (SIZZLING)
Oh! I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it!
I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.
Spill.
RHODEY: Do you know what they did to my suit?
What? No.
But I do know it's happening off the coast.
Something to do with a big boat.
I can take you there.
(CHANTING) Olé, olé, olé, olé...
Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.
Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well.
Is that... Is that important?
- Somewhat. - Yeah, a little bit.
TONY: So?
RHODEY: What are we gonna do?
I mean, we don't have any transport.
- Right. (BEER OPENS)
Hey, Ringo.
Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"?
If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
But we also have to figure out this
- vice president thing, right? - Right.
I wonder who I'm calling right now.
Oh! That's the vice president.
Thanks.
Hello?
TONY: Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Welcome back to the land of the living.
We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign.
We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham,
surrounded by the Agency's finest.
The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes.
I think we're good, here.
RHODEY: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.
They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse.
They're gonna take out the president somehow.
We have to immediately alert that plane.
Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down.
If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.
- Thank you, Colonel. - Rhodes and Stark out.
Everything okay, sir?
Couldn't be better.
I love you, babe.
Colonel Rhodes.
Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.
RHODEY: We gotta make a decision.
We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu.
The cranes have finally arrived,
and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
TONY: And what about the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
That's going to have to do.
Oh! Here he comes. Here he comes. Get a quick picture.
Sure.
Oh!

Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Get me eyes on it now.

Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us.

But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...
(SIGHING) That came out of nowhere.
Wow.
Give me some good news, man.
I think they all made it.
Oh, thank God.
Yeah, but I missed the president.
You couldn't save the president with the suit,
how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
The House Party protocol sir?
Correct.
(GASPS)
Hi.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
You think he's gonna help you?
He won't.
Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um...
Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that.
You're here as my, um...
Trophy.
(CHUCKLES) Mmm.
Good evening, sir.
(GASPS)
Welcome aboard, Mr President.
KILLIAN: Ever hear of an elephant graveyard?
Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.
This is the Roxxon Norco.
And, of course, you'll remember
that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola,
thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.
What do you want from me?
Uh, nothing, sir.
I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV.
You see, I've moved on.
I found myself a new political patron,
and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job.
String him up.
Hey!

You're not gonna freak out on me, right?

I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.

You've got, like, five of them.
Here's what I'm going to do.
Save my spot, ready?

Here we go. (CLEARS THROAT)

Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?
Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.
Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down!
You're right. I don't deserve her.

I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet?
Who's the hot mess now?
It's still debatable.
Probably tipping your way a little bit.
Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm?
Sport bra. The whole deal.
You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits.
What am I going to complain about now?
Well, it's me.
You'll think of something.
- No, don't touch me. - Don't worry about it.
- No, I'm gonna burn you. - No, you're not.
Not hot.
Am I gonna be okay?
No.
You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay.
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.
I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk.
I think I can get you better.
That's what I do. I fix stuff.
And all your distractions?
Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit.
Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
You know what to do.
The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.
(KISSES)
Okay, so far? Do you like it?
(SIGHS)
It'll do.
TONY: And so, as Christmas morning began,
my journey had reached its end.
You start with something pure,
something exciting. Then, come the mistakes.
The compromises.
- We create our own demons. (REPORTERS CALLING)
- Oh! (ALL CLAMOURING)
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
TONY: As promised, I got Pepper sorted out. It took some tinkering.
But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?"
Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous,
but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.
And now, neither will I.
- Let me tell you... (METAL CLINKING)
...that was the best sleep I'd had in years.
(GASPING)
(COUGHING)
It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay.
(WEAKLY) No, look.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)
(LAUGHS)
TONY: So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever...
I guess I'd say my armour, it was never a distraction,
or a hobby.
It was a cocoon.
And now,
I'm a changed man.
You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys.
One thing you can't take away...
I am Iron Man.
(THRILLING MUSIC PLAYING)
(OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING)
TONY: You know, and thank you by the way. For listening.
Plus, something about just getting it off my chest,
and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in...
I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know.
Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.
To be able to share all my intimate thoughts
and my experiences with someone,
it just cuts the weight of it in half.
You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail.
Everything comes full circle.
(GASPS) - And the fact that you've been able to
- help me process... (CLEARS THROAT)
- Are you with me? - Sorry... I was, yeah.
We were at, uh...
Are you actively napping?
(STAMMERING) I was... I... I drifted.
Where did I lose you?
Elevator in Switzerland.
So, you heard none of it.
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.
I'm not a therapist.
- It's not my training. - So?
- I don't have the... - What? The time?
Temperament.
You know what? Now that I think about it...
Oh! God, my original wound.
- 1983, all right? - Yes.
I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.

I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial.
This is crazy. What did I do?
I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me.
What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
We can talk, sir.
- Oh, I see. So it's personal? - No, you intimidate them.
Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that.
I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here?
- I thought of you as a soldier first. - I'm an airman.
You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there.
I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now.
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.
- Sir, I have a question to ask. - Yes, please.
Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question. Yes and no.
March and I had a scheduling conflict,
but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins.
Anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you? - Yes. It's very cool.
All right.
I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.
Please, no gang signs.
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.
Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.
- What's going on? - Contact left!
What have we got?
Jimmy, stay with Stark!
- Stay down! - Yeah.
Son of a bitch!
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun! - Stay here!
Whoa!
Tony Stark.
Visionary. Genius.
American patriot.
Even from an early age,
the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark
quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind.
At age four, he built his first circuit board.
At age six, his first engine.
And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT.
Then, the passing of a titan.
Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane,
steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder,
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns
and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries.
With the keys to the kingdom,
Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy,
creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting.
Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry
by ensuring freedom and protecting America
and her interests around the globe.
As liaison to Stark Industries,
I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot.
He is my friend and he is my great mentor.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor
to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark.
Tony?
- Thank you, Colonel. - Thanks for the save.
This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much.
This is wonderful.
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.
But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel
and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award.
Tony, you know...
The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing.
He's always working.
Work it! Come on!
- We should just stay till the morning. - You are unbelievable.
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this? - Nobody roped me into anything!
- I'm so sorry. - But they told me that
if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.
Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great.
- So when do we do it? - It's right here.
- Here you go. - There it is. That was easy.
- I'm so sorry. - Yeah, it's okay.
Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else.
I don't have any of those floating around.
We're gonna let it ride!
Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.
Okay, you, too.
- I don't blow on a man's dice. - Come on, honey bear.
There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Two craps. Line away.
- That's what happens. - Worse things have happened.
I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will you?
- This is where I exit. - All right.
Tomorrow, don't be late.
- Yeah, you can count on it. - I'm serious!
I know, I know.
Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. There you go.
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!
Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine.
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
- She's cute. - She's all right?
- Hi. - Hi.
- Yeah. Okay, go. - It's okay?
You've been called the da Vinci of our time.
- What do you say to that? - Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
And what do you say to your other nickname?
"The Merchant of Death"?
That's not bad.
- Let me guess. Berkeley? - Brown, actually.
Well, Ms. Brown,
it's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got.
I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace,
I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Rehearse that much?
Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
- I can see that. - I'd like to show you first-hand.
All I want is a serious answer.
Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy,
"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."
That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project.
A lot of people, including your professors at Brown,
would call that being a hero.
And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved
by advancing medical technology
or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops?
All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.
The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.
The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines.
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
Tony?
Hey, Tony?
You are not authorized to access this area.
- Jesus. - That's Jarvis. He runs the house.
I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,
and there's a car waiting for you outside
that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts. - Indeed I am.
After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.
I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires,
including, occasionally, taking out the trash.
Will that be all?
Give me an exploded view.
The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
Log that.
- I'm gonna try again, right now. - Please don't turn down my music.
I'll keep you posted.
You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
- How'd she take it? - Like a champ.
Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all,
that it would just wait for me to get there.
Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things
before I get you out of the door.
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane
if it departs before you arrive?
Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.
Do you want it? Yes or no.
Is it a good representation of his spring period?
No. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton
where he lived and worked,
- not "spring" like the season. - So?
I think it's a fair example. I think it's incredibly overpriced.
I need it. Buy it. Store it.
Okay. The MIT commencement speech...
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...
They're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.
Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
- As a matter of fact, I do. - I don't like it when you have plans.
I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
- It's your birthday? - Yes.
I knew that. Already?
Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
- Get yourself something nice from me. - I already did.
- And? - It was very nice.
- Yeah. - Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
You're welcome, Miss Potts.
Okay.
You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
You did, sir. I had to cut across Mulholland.
I got you. I got you.
What's wrong with you?
- What? - Three hours.
I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.
Wheels up! Rock and roll!
- What you reading, platypus? - Nothing.
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.
I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?
- I said I was sorry. - Good morning, Mr. Stark.
You don't need to apologize to me. I'm your man.
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...
- I'm just indifferent right now. - Hot towel?
You don't respect yourself,
- so I know you don't respect me. - I respect you.
I'm just your babysitter.
So, when you need your diaper changed... Thank you.
Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?
- Thanks for reminding me. - No, I'm not talking...
We're not drinking. We're working right now.
- You can't have sashimi without sake. - You are constitutionally
incapable of being responsible.
It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
Hot sake?
- Yes, two, please. - No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
That's what I'm talking about.
When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform,
you know what I recognize?
I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!
Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...
No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.
Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!
General.
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.
Thanks.
Is it better to be feared or respected?
I say, is it too much to ask for both?
With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.
It's the first missile system
to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology.
They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire.
I respectfully disagree.
I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once.
That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it.
And it's worked out pretty well so far.
Find an excuse
to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you
the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.
For your consideration, the Jericho.
I'll be throwing one of these in
with every purchase of 500 million or more.
To peace!
- Tony. - Obie, what are you doing up?
I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Good night, Tony.
- Hey, Tony. - I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.
- Nice job. - See you back at base.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
What the hell did you do to me?
What I did?
What I did is to save your life.
I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left,
and it's headed into your atrial septum.
Here, want to see?
I have a souvenir. Take a look.
I've seen many wounds like that in my village.
We call them the walking dead
because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.
- What is this? - That is an electromagnet,
hooked up to a car battery,
and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart.
That's right. Smile.
We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.
- I don't remember. - No, you wouldn't.
If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand,
much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.
Where are we?
Come on, stand up. Stand up!
Just do as I do.
Come on, put your hands up.
Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
Do you understand me? Do as I do.
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer
"in the history of America."
He is honored.
He wants you to build the missile.
The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.
This one.
I refuse.
Tony!
He wants to know what you think.
I think you got a lot of my weapons.
He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.
He wants you to make the list of materials.
He says for you to start working immediately,
and when you're done, he will set you free.
- No, he won't. - No, he won't.
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.
But they will never find you in these mountains.
Look, what you just saw,
that is your legacy, Stark.
Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers.
Is that how you want to go out?
Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark?
Or are you going to do something about it?
Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way.
And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
Well, then,
this is a very important week for you, isn't it?
If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up.
I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.
I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.
I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.
- How many languages do you speak? - A lot.
But apparently, not enough for this place.
They speak Arabic, Urdu,
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
- Who are these people? - They are your loyal customers, sir.
They call themselves the Ten Rings.
You know, we might be more productive
if you include me in the planning process.
Okay, we don't need this.
What is that?
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.
We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?
What's he doing?
Working.
Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
Relax. I have steady hands.
Why do you think you're still alive?
- What do I call you? - My name is Yinsen.
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor.
I got a big one powering my factory at home.
It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
But what could it generate?
If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.
That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
- This is our ticket out of here. - What is it?
Flatten them out and look.
Oh, wow.
Impressive.
Good.
Good roll. Good roll.
You still haven't told me where you're from.
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.
- It's actually a nice place. - Got a family?
Yes, and I will see them when I leave here.
And you, Stark?
- No. - No?
So you're a man who has everything
and nothing.
It doesn't look anything like the picture.
Maybe it's been modified.
The tail is wrong.
It's just backwards.
Relax.
The bow and arrow
once was the pinnacle of weapons technology.
It allowed the great Genghis Khan
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.
An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great
and four times the size of the Roman Empire.
But today,
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons
rules these lands.
And soon,
it will be my turn.
Why have you failed me?
We're working.
Diligently.
I let you live.
This is how you repay me?
It's very complex.
He's trying very hard.
On his knees.
You think I'm a fool?
I'll get the truth.
We're both working.
Open your mouth.
What does he want?
You think I'm a fool?
What's going on?
Tell me the truth.
He's building your Jericho.
What do you want? A delivery date?
I need him.
Good assistant.
You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
Okay? Can you move?
Okay, say it again.
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,
that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.
Where is Stark?
He was here a moment ago.
Go look for him.
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!
Say something. Say something back to him.
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't... - Then speak Hungarian.
- Okay. I know. - What do you know?
- How'd that work? - Oh, my goodness.
- It worked all right. - That's what I do.
- Let me finish this. - Initialize the power sequence.
Okay.
- Now! - Tell me. Tell me.
Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar.
- It should be up right now. - Yes.
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
- I have it. - Press Control "l".
- "I." Got it. - "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."
Come over here and button me up.
Okay. All right.
Every other hex bolt.
- They're coming! - Nothing pretty, just get it done.
- Just get it done. - They're coming.
Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?
We need more time.
Hey,
- I'm gonna go buy you some time. - Stick to the plan!
Stick to the plan!
Yinsen!
- Yinsen! - Watch out!
Stark.
Come on. We got to go.
Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.
This was always the plan, Stark.
Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.
My family is dead.
I'm going to see them now, Stark.
It's okay.
I want this. I want this.
Thank you for saving me.
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
My turn.
Not bad.
Hey!
How was the "fun-vee"?
Next time, you ride with me, okay?
Watch it, coming up here.
Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.
Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting. - Yeah, vacation's over.
Where to, sir?
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy. - No.
No? Tony, you have to
- go to the hospital. - No is a complete answer.
- The doctor has to look at you. - I don't have to do anything.
I've been in captivity for three months.
There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger,
- and the other... - That's enough of that.
...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
- Call for a press conference? - Yeah.
- What on earth for? - Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
Look at this!
Tony.
- We were going to meet at the hospital. - No, I'm fine.
Look at you!
- You had to have a burger, yeah? - Well, come on.
- You get me one of those? - There's only one left. I need it.
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!
- Miss Potts? - Yes.
Can I speak to you for a moment?
I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now.
I'm not a reporter.
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,
with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement
and Logistics Division.
- That's quite a mouthful. - I know. We're working on it.
You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...
We're a separate division with a more specific focus.
We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
- I'll put something in the book, shall I? - Thank you.
Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?
Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can...
A little less formal and...
- What's up with the love-in? - Don't look at me.
I don't know what he's up to.
- Good to see you. - Good to see you.
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.
I never got to say goodbye to my father.
There's questions that I would have asked him.
I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did.
If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts.
Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels.
I saw young Americans killed
by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them.
And I saw
that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
- Mr. Stark! - Hey, Ben.
What happened over there?
I had my eyes opened. I came to realize that I have more
to offer this world than just making things that blow up.
And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down
the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International
until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.
I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.
What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with
and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well.
What we should take away from this is that Tony's back!
And he's healthier than ever.
We're going to have a little internal discussion
and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.
- Where is he? - He's inside.
Well, that... That went well.
Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
Your head? What about my head?
What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
- Optimistically, 40 points. - At minimum.
Yep.
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.
Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.
That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
It's my name on the side of the building.
And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
Not based on what I saw.
We're not doing a good enough job.
We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
Come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!
Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up!
- It works. - Yeah, as a science project.
The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it.
Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?
Maybe.
Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what?
- Thirty years. - That's what they say.
Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?
- Never mind who told me. Show me. - It's Rhodey or Pepper.
- I want to see it. - Okay, Rhodey.
- Okay. - Okay?
It works.
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand?
There's nothing we can't do if we stick together,
like your father and I.
I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay?
- But if I had... - Tony.
Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business.
- You understand me? - That was Dad's line.
You gotta let me handle this.
We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now.
We're going to have to take a lot of heat.
I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
Stark Industries!
I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready?
Sell, sell, sell!
Abandon ship!
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?
Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan!
Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!
Pepper. How big are your hands?
- What? - How big are your hands?
- I don't understand why... - Get down here. I need you.
Hey.
Let's see them. Show me your hands.
Let's see them.
Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed.
I just need your help for a sec.
Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?
It was. It is now an antique.
This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future.
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.
- Speed bump, what does that mean? - It's nothing. It's just a little snag.
There's an exposed wire under this device.
And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short.
It's fine.
- What do you want me to do? - Put that on the table over there.
- That is irrelevant. - Oh, my God!
I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
- Is it safe? - Yeah, it should be fine.
It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch
the socket wall or it goes "beep."
- What do you mean, "Operation"? - It's just a game, never mind.
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great. - Okay.
You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.
No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified,
trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great.
Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...
- Okay, okay. - I really need your help here.
Okay.
Oh, there's pus!
It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device,
- not from my body. - It smells!
Yeah, it does.
The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?
- Okay, I got it! I got it! - Okay, you got it?
Now, don't let it touch the sides when you're coming out!
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That's what I was trying to tell you before.
Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, you don't...
There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.
- Oh, God! - Okay, I was not expecting...
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in! - Okay, what do I do?
What's wrong?
Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...
- What? You said it was safe! - We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.
- You gotta switch it out really quick. - Okay. Okay.
- Tony? It's going to be okay. - What?
- Is it? - It's gonna be okay.
- I'm gonna make this okay. - Let's hope.
Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make sure you...
Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here.
Nice.
- Are you okay? - Yeah, I feel great.
You okay?
Don't ever, ever, ever,
ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.
I don't have anyone but you.
Anyway...
- What do you want me to do with this? - That?
Destroy it.
Incinerate it.
You don't want to keep it?
Pepper, I've been called many things. "Nostalgic" is not one of them.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - That will be all, Miss Potts.
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.
What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk?
That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad.
Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.
The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned?
I'll tell you, in my experience,
no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct,
his insight,
that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious
and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.
Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.
- Hello, sir. - Speaking of manned or unmanned,
you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong
at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987.
- That lovely lady you woke up with. - Don't do that!
- What was his name? - Don't do that.
- Was it Ivan? - Don't do that.
They'll believe it. Don't do that.
- Okay. - Don't do that.
- Pleasure meeting you. - Give us a couple minutes, you guys.
- I'm surprised. - Why?
I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.
I'm doing a little better than walking.
- Really? - Yeah.
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.
I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.
You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy,
'cause that little stunt at the press conference,
that was a doozy.
This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
What? You're a humanitarian now or something?
- I need you to listen to me. - No.
What you need is time to get your mind right.
- I'm serious. - Okay.
It's nice seeing you, Tony.
Thanks.
- Jarvis, you up? - For you, sir, always.
I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark II.
Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
Actually, I don't know who to trust right now.
Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
Working on a secret project, are we, sir?
I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands.
Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.
Next. Up.
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me?
Stay put. Nice.
You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this.
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?
Up.
Screw it. Don't even move.
You are a tragedy.
Okay, let's do this right.
Start mark, half a meter, and back and center.
Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety.
You, roll it.
Okay. Activate hand controls.
We're gonna start off nice and easy.
We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift.
And three,
two,
one.
Up two. All right, set that.
I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Yeah, everything's... What?
- Obadiah's upstairs. - Great!
- What would you like me to tell him? - Great. I'll be right up.
Okay.
I thought you said you were done making weapons.
It is.
This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.
I didn't expect that.
How'd it go?
It went that bad, huh?
Just because I brought pizza back from New York
- doesn't mean it went bad. - Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
It would have gone better if you were there.
You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing.
- I lay low, and you take care of all... - Hey, come on. In public. The press.
- This was a board of directors meeting. - This was a board of directors meeting?
The board is claiming you have posttraumatic stress.
They're filing an injunction.
- A what? - They want to lock you out.
Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points?
We knew that was gonna happen.
- Fifty-six and a half. - It doesn't matter.
We own the controlling interest in the company.
Tony, the board has rights, too.
They're making the case that you and your new direction
- isn't in the company's best interest. - I'm being responsible!
That's a new direction for me, for the company.
I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that...
This is great.
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony. - I'll be in the shop.
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.
I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something.
Something to pitch them.
Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.
- No. No, absolutely not. - It'll give me a bone to throw the boys
- in New York! - This one stays with me.
- That's it, Obie. Forget it. - All right, well, this stays with me, then.
Go on, here, you can have a piece.
- Take two. - Thank you.
You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
Good night, Obie.
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option,
Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again,
and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college.
All right, nice and easy.
Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity.
And three, two, one.
Okay.
Please don't follow me around with it, either,
'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously.
Just stand down! If something happens, then come in.
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.
Three, two, one.
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!
Not the car, not the car!
Table!
Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay.
No!
Yeah, I can fly.
- Jarvis, are you there? - At your service, sir.
- Engage Heads Up Display. - Check.
Import all preferences from home interface.
Will do, sir.
All right, what do you say?
I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.
Can we start the virtual walk-around?
Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
Do a check on control surfaces.
As you wish.
Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
Yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check.
Start listening in on ground control.
Sir, there are still terabytes
of calculations needed before an actual flight is...
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk.
Ready? In three, two, one.
Handles like a dream.
All right, let's see what this thing can do.
What's SR-71 's record?
The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
Records are made to be broken! Come on!
Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.
Keep going!
Higher!
We iced up, Jarvis! Deploy flaps! Jarvis!
Come on, we got to break the ice!
Kill power.
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude.
Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
A very astute observation, sir.
Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets,
we should improve the exosystems.
Connect to the sys. Co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals.
Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite.
That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.
- Got it? - Yes.
Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Thrill me.
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall,
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund
has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society.
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?
I have no record of an invitation, sir.
...hasn't been seen in public
since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference.
Some claim he's suffering from posttraumatic stress
and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be,
no one expects an appearance from him tonight.
The render is complete.
A little ostentatious, don't you think?
What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
Yes, that should help you keep a low profile.
The render is complete.
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
Commencing automated assembly.
Estimated completion time is five hours.
Don't wait up for me, honey.
Weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries
is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...
- Hey, Tony, remember me? - Sure don't.
You look great, Hef.
We're going to have a great quarter.
What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.
I'll see you inside.
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?
I think I got the board right where we want them.
You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute.
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving. - Mr. Stark?
- Yeah? - Agent Coulson.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the...
Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
God, you need a new name for that.
Yeah, I hear that a lot.
Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you.
There's still a lot of unanswered questions,
and time can be a factor with these things.
Let's just put something on the books.
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. At Stark Industries?
Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right.
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date.
You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.
- What are you doing here? - Just avoiding government agents.
- Are you by yourself? - Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
- Oh, it was a birthday present. - That's great.
- From you, actually. - Well, I got great taste.
Yes.
- You want to dance? - Oh, no.
- All right, come on. - Thank you. No.
Am I making you uncomfortable?
No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss
in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.
- You look great and you smell great. - Oh, God.
But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.
- I'd make it a week. Sure. - Really?
What's your Social Security number?
- Five. - Five?
- Right. - Right.
You're missing just a couple of digits there.
The other eight? So I got you for the other eight.
- How about a little air? - Yes, I need some air.
- That was totally weird. - Totally harmless.
It was totally not harmless, by the way.
We're dancing. No one's even watching.
Everybody who I work with... No, you know why?
I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you.
And everybody knows exactly who you are
and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine.
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,
- and I'm dancing with you. - I don't think it was taken that way.
Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...
- I just think you're overstating it. - You know, and we're here,
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous
dress, and then we were dancing like that and...
- I would like a drink, please. - Got it, okay.
- I would like a vodka martini, please. - Okay.
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.
Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast.
Make one of them dirty, will you?
Wow. Tony Stark.
- Oh, hey. - Fancy seeing you here.
- Carrie. - Christine.
That's right.
You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight.
Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
'Cause I was referring to your company's
involvement in this latest atrocity.
Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.
I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.
Is this what you call accountability?
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?
- When were these taken? - Yesterday.
- I didn't approve any shipment. - Well, your company did.
Well, I'm not my company.
- Please, do you mind? - Have you seen these pictures?
- What's going on in Gulmira? - Tony, Tony.
- You can't afford to be this naive. - You know what? I was naive before,
when they said, "Here's the line. We don't cross it.
"This is how we do business."
If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?
Tony, your picture, please!
Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time!
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?
I was the one who filed the injunction against you.
It was the only way I could protect you.
No. No.
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described
as a descent into hell, into a modern day Heart of Darkness.
Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages
have been driven from their homes,
displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power.
Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings
they can find in the ruins of other villages,
or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant.
Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.
As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission.
A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way.
With no political will or international pressure,
there's very little hope for these refugees.
Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband,
who was kidnapped by insurgents,
either forced to join their militia...
Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs,
holding them up to anyone who will stop.
A child's simple question, "Where are my mother and father?"
There's very little hope for these refugees,
refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.
Hurry it up.
Put the women in the trucks.
Stack the weapons here.
Clear all the houses.
That one there. Faster. Faster.
Grab that dog.
Put him with the others.
What the hell is this?
Shoot this dog.
You're all incompetent.
Turn your head.
He's all yours.
What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?
No, they were using human shields. We never got the green light.
Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
Get those monitors up!
We got a bogey!
- Wasn't Air Force! - We got the CIA on the line?
I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.
No, it definitely is not us, sir!
- It wasn't Navy. - Wasn't Marines.
I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?
- Negative, negative. - Cannot identify.
Get me Colonel Rhodes from Weapons Development down here now!
We ran an ID check and cross-referenced
with all known databases. We have nothing.
Any high altitude surveillance in the region?
We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.
So this thing just appeared out of nowhere?
How come it didn't show up on the radar?
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.
- Is it stealth? - No, sir, it's tiny.
We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?
- Let me make a call. - Sergeant, clear a hole.
- Hello? - Tony?
- Who's this? - It's Rhodes.
- Sorry, hello? - I said it's Rhodes.
- Speak up, please. - What in the hell is that noise?
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down. - Yeah, well, I need your help right now.
It's funny how that works, huh?
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up
a few clicks from where you were being held captive.
Well, that's a hot spot.
Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.
- I thought you were driving. - Right, I was driving
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.
You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
- Nope! - Bogey spotted!
- Whiplash, come in hot. - Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one
right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.
That's my exit.
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sights.
Whiplash One, what is it?
I've got no idea.
- You have radio contact? - Non responsive, sir.
Then you are clear to engage.
Hit it.
That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!
- Inbound missile. - Flares!
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!
Deploy flaps!
Holy!
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.
The sat visual has been lost.
No way that's a UAV.
What is it?
I can't see anything.
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.
I think bogey's been handled, sir.
- Hello? - Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
- It's who? - I'm sorry, it is me.
You asked. What you were asking about is me.
No, see, this isn't a game.
You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone.
- You understand that? - This is not a piece of equipment.
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Rhodey, you got anything for me?
- Mark your position and return to base. - Roger that, Ballroom.
On your belly!
It looks like a man!
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!
I'm hit! I'm hit!
It's confirmed. He has been hit.
Punch out! Punch out!
Whiplash One down.
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?
Negative! No chute, no chute!
My chute's jammed!
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.
Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.
Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at.
- Call off the Raptors. - That thing just took out an F-22
inside a legal no fly zone!
Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!
You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
Keep going!
Good chute! Good chute!
- Tony, you still there? - Hey, thanks.
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.
You owe me a plane. You know that, right?
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.
Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?
No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better.
Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?
Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
It's not that simple.
An unfortunate training exercise
involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday.
I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured.
As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira,
it is still unclear who or what intervened,
but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.
Hey!
It is a tight fit, sir.
Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.
Be gentle. This is my first time.
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.
- I really should be able to... - Please, try not to move, sir.
What's going on here?
Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Are those bullet holes?
Welcome.
Compliments of Tony Stark.
If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face.
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.
Show me the weapon.
Come. Leave your guards outside.
His escape bore unexpected fruit.
So this is how he did it.
This is only a first, crude effort.
Stark has perfected his design.
He has made a masterpiece of death.
A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia.
And you dream of Stark's throne.
We have a common enemy.
If we are still in business,
I will give you these designs
as a gift.
And in turn,
I hope you'll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers.
This is the only gift you shall receive.
Technology.
It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world.
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.
That's the least of your problems.
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.
All right, let's finish up here.
Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor,
and I'm going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers.
I want a prototype right away.
Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand?
I need you to go to my office.
You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all
the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip.
This'll get you in.
It's probably under Executive Files.
If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need
to look for the lowest numeric heading.
And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?
Same drill.
They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them.
I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.
Tony,
you know that I would help you with anything,
but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.
There is nothing except this. There's no art opening.
There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign.
There is the next mission and nothing else.
Is that so?
Well, then, I quit.
You stood by my side all these years
while I reaped the benefits of destruction.
And now that I'm trying to protect the people
that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
I shouldn't be alive,
unless it was for a reason.
I'm not crazy, Pepper.
I just finally know what I have to do.
And I know in my heart that it's right.
You're all I have, too, you know.
Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?
You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane... - Oh, my God.
...your deception and lies will cost you dearly.
The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.
So, what are we going to do about this?
I know what you're going through, Pepper.
Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he?
I was so happy when he came home.
It was like we got him back from the dead.
Now I realize,
well, Tony never really did come home, did he?
He left a part of himself in that cave.
Breaks my heart.
Well, he's a complicated person.
He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right.
You are a very rare woman.
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.
Thank you. Thanks.
I'd better get back there.
Is that today's paper?
Yes.
Do you mind?
- Not at all. - Puzzle.
Of course.
Take care.
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?
Nope, right now. Come with me.
- Right now? - We're going to have it right now.
- Yeah, walk with me. - Okay.
I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.
Yeah, we've been working our best to do it.
Absolutely, we're... I'm going to have to call you back.
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored
what you've asked us, and it seems as though there's a little hiccup.
- Actually... - A hiccup?
Yes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn't exist.
- So it's... - Wait, wait, wait. The technology?
William, here is the technology. I've asked you to simply make it smaller.
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying to do, but honestly, it's impossible.
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.
Tony?
Tony, are you there? Hello?
Breathe.
Easy, easy.
You remember this one, right?
It's a shame the government didn't approve it.
There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis.
Tony.
When I ordered the hit on you,
I worried that I was
killing the golden goose.
But, you see, it was just
fate that you survived that.
You had one last golden egg to give.
Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you?
Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb.
Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.
What a masterpiece. Look at that.
This is your legacy.
A new generation of weapons with this at its heart.
Weapons that will help steer the world back on course,
put the balance of power in our hands.
The right hands.
I wish you could see my prototype.
It's not as...
Well, not as conservative as yours.
Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this.
I would have preferred that she lived.
What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed?
Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah...
Okay, where's Tony now?
I don't know. He's not answering his phone.
Please go over there and make sure everything's okay.
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.
Good boy.
Tony?
Tony!
Tony! You okay?
- Where's Pepper? - She's fine. She's with five agents.
They're about to arrest Obadiah.
That's not going to be enough.
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.
My key's not working. It's not opening the door.
Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device?
It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?
You might want to take a few steps back.
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.
You need me to do anything else?
Keep the skies clear.
Damn!
Next time, baby.
Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.
I thought it'd be bigger.
Take him out!
How do you think the Mark I chest piece is going to hold up?
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.
That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.
Keep me posted.
Pepper!
- Tony! Tony, are you okay? - I'm fine. How are...
- Obadiah, he's gone insane! - I know.
- Listen, you'd better get out of there. - He built a suit.
Get out of there right now!
Where do you think you're going?
Your services are no longer required.
Stane!
I love this suit!
- Put them down! - Collateral damage, Tony.
Divert power to chest RT.
Power reduced to 19%.
Lady!
No, no, no, no, no, no!
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!
I built this company from nothing!
Nothing is going to stand in my way.
Least of all you!
Impressive! You've upgraded your armor!
I've made some upgrades of my own!
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.
Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that...
I know the math! Do it!
Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back.
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!
Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.
Yes, sir.
- Thirteen percent power, sir. - Climb!
- Eleven percent. - Keep going!
- Seven percent power. - Just leave it on the screen!
Stop telling me!
You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!
How'd you solve the icing problem?
Icing problem?
Might want to look into it.
Two percent.
We are now running on emergency backup power.
- Potts! - Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Nice try!
- Weapons status? - Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.
Flares!
Very clever, Tony.
- Potts? - Tony!
This isn't working.
We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
- Well, how are you going to do that? - You're going to do it.
Go to the central console, open up all the circuits.
When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know.
You're going to hit the master bypass button.
It's going to fry everything up here.
Okay. I'm going in now.
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time.
This looks important!
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,
but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit!
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!
You'd have made your father proud!
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!
Tony!
How ironic, Tony!
Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!
- Pepper! - And now I'm going to kill you with it!
- You ripped out my targeting system! - Time to hit the button!
- You told me not to! - Hold still, you little prick!
- Just do it! - You'll die!
Push it!
Tony!
You've all received the official statement of what occurred
at Stark Industries last night.
There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned
and caused damage to the arc reactor.
Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it.
I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,
but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.
Here's your alibi.
Okay.
- You were on your yacht. - Yeah.
We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night,
and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.
See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me
alone on the island.
- That's what happened. - All right.
Just read it, word for word.
There's nothing about Stane here.
That's being handled. He's on vacation.
Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.
But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard?
He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.
Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you.
You've got 90 seconds.
Agent Coulson?
I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.
That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.
- From the Strategic Homeland... - Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Right.
- Let's get this show on the road. - You know, it's actually not that bad.
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.
- You're not Iron Man. - Am so.
- You're not. - All right, suit yourself.
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity.
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die,
yet so proud of the man I'd become.
She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more
crazy about me.
Tell me you never think about that night.
- What night? - You know.
Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof,
and then you went downstairs to get me a drink,
and you left me there, by myself?
Is that the night you're talking about?
Thought so.
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark? - Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.
And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement.
He will not be taking any questions. Thank you.
Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.
There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred
on the freeway and the rooftop...
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that
that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared,
- despite the fact that you... - I know that it's confusing.
It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely
to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
I never said you were a superhero.
Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic.
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.
With this laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes I've made,
- largely public. - Just stick to the cards, man.
Yeah, okay. Yeah.
The truth is
I am Iron Man.
Jarvis!
Welcome home, sir.
"I am Iron Man." You think you're the only superhero in the world?
Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe.
You just don't know it yet.
Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
I'm here to talk to you about the Avenger Initiative.

Nick, this was a tragedy, but it's not why we're here.
What, are we fighting the weather now?
Locals say the cyclone had a face.
People see things when they're under stress.
That does not mean that this is the start to some other big world-ending
Who are you?
You don't want any part of this.
Gone but not forgotten.
Thanks to Kenneth Lim and Vihaan Ramamurthy
for their help with that touching video tribute.
This year has been nothing short of ***. It is crazy. It's insane.
Jason. What?
No swearing.
It's the last day of school. We're good.
Historic.
Over five years ago, half of all life in the universe,
including our own Midtown High, was wiped from existence.
Then eight months ago, a band of brave heroes
brought us back.
They called it "the Blip."
Those of us who Blipped away came back the same age
But our classmates that didn't Blip had grown five years older.
My little brother is now older than me. Yeah, it's math.
Even though we had Blipped away halfway through the school year
and had already taken midterms,
the school made us start the whole year over from the beginning.
It's totally unfair.
It's not right.
Tigers, it's been a long, dramatic, somewhat confusing road.
As we draw this year to a close,
it's time to move on
to a new phase of our lives. Pray nothing crazy happens again
because are the Avengers even a thing anymore?
Does anyone even have a plan? I have a plan.
Okay, first, I'm gonna sit next to MJ on the flight.
Second, I'm gonna buy a dual-headphone adapter
and watch movies with her the whole time.
Okay. Three, when we go to Venice
Venice is famous for making stuff out of glass, right?
True. So I'm gonna buy her
a black dahlia necklace because her favorite flower is the black dahlia
because of, well The murder.
The murder. Four, when we go to Paris,
I'm gonna take her to the top of the Eiffel Tower,
give her the necklace.
Then, five, I'm gonna tell her how I feel.
Then, six, hopefully she tells me she feels the same way.
Oh, don't forget step seven.
Step seven? Don't do any of that.
Why? We're gonna be bachelors in Europe.
Ned. Look,
I may not know much, but I do know this:
Europeans love Americans.
Really? More than half of them are women.
Okay. Sure.
But I really like MJ, man, okay?
She's awesome, she's super funny in a kind of dark way.
Sometimes I catch her looking at me, I feel like I've stood up
She's coming. Don't say anything. What up, dorks?
Excited about the science trip? Hey, we're talking about the trip.
Yeah, and Peter's plan. You have a plan?
I don't I don't have a plan.
No, he's just gonna collect tiny spoons when we're traveling to other countries.
Like a grandmother?
I'm not collecting tiny spoons. He's collecting tiny spoons.
Oh, okay, well
that was a real roller coaster.
By the way, travel tip:
You should download a VPN on your phone,
so the government can't track you while we're abroad.
Smart. Will do.
Dude, I think that went really great.
When I Blipped back to my apartment,
the family that was living there was very confused.
The wife thought that I was a mistress.
The grandma thought that I was a ghost. It was It was really a mess.
Thank you for coming out
to support those who have been displaced by the Blip.
And, of course, thanks to our very own Spider-Man!
Thank you, Miss Parker, for having me.
And thank you, you guys, for having me.
And thank you, Spider-Man.
He'll be right back out to take photos and videos. Thank you!
That was amazing. That was great.
That was so cool. I was so nervous. I was a little stiff. I wasn't in the pocket.
I thought you did great. You were a little stiff.
Yeah, I felt that too. I felt that too.
It's fine, it's fine. Okay.
Did you get your passport? Yeah.
Mini toothpaste? Yeah, I did.
Hey, sorry I'm late.
Happy. Hey. Oh, you look lovely.
Thanks. You too. Thank you.
New dress? Yeah, yes, it is.
It's a new beard. It's my My Blip beard.
I grew it in the Blip.
It's a Blip beard.
I see. Yeah.
The reason I'm late is because this was misplaced at the office.
Can you believe it? Because it's enormous. Not the amount, the size.
The amount's nice too. They're generous.
Pepper said, sorry she couldn't be here. Yeah. Thank you.
I think I'm gonna go change the Sterno under the vegan lasagna.
Spider-Man, go shake hands.
Will do.
What just happened?
Heads up, Nick Fury's calling you.
Fury's gonna call me? Why? Yeah.
Why? He probably has hero stuff for you to do.
You're a superhero. He calls superheroes.
If it was that important, he'd probably call someone else, not me.
Apparently not.
No caller ID. That's him. I don't wanna talk to Fury.
Answer the phone. Why?
If you don't talk to him, I have to, and I don't want to.
Why not? Because I'm scared. Answer the phone.
You sent Nick Fury to voicemail? Yeah.
You don't send Fury to voicemail. Hear that? They're calling me.
I gotta go. You gotta talk to him.
I'm gonna call him. I promise you, I'm gonna call him. I will.
You do not ghost Nick Fury.
I promise you, I'll call him.
After my trip.
Hey!
Yeah, hi No, no, he's not ghosting you.
Okay, one question at a time.
Are you the head Avenger? Are you the head Avenger now?
No, I'm not.
If the aliens come back, what are you gonna do?
If the aliens come back, what will you do?
Does anyone have any neighborhood questions?
Sean Winford, Queens Tribune.
What it is like to take over from Tony Stark?
Those are some big shoes to fill.
I'm I'm gonna go. Thanks so much, everyone, for coming.
Okay.
Hungry?
So sorry.
I thought you could sense that with your Peter-tingle.
Please do not start calling it my Peter-tingle.
What's up? You can dodge bullets but not bananas?
No, I just really need this vacation. I need a break.
You deserve it.
Yeah.
You know what?
You should pack your suit, just in case. I have a tingle about it.
Please stop saying "tingle," May.
No.
No. No, I'm not.
Yeah! Can you help me get my stuff up here?
Oh, sorry, that's mine. No worries.
Middle seat gets both armrests. Give me a tablet.
Do you want the first shift or the second? I could take either.
Give me the third shift. I took an Ambien.
I can't chaperone these kids alone. Yo, Parker.
This is called an airplane. It's like the buses you're used to,
except it flies over the poor neighborhoods instead of driving through them.
Ma'am?
He Blipped, so technically, he's 16, not 21.
I'll take that.
She's lying. I don't even know this girl.
Classic MJ, right?
Did you know Brad was coming?
It It's so weird.
One day, he's that kid who cried and got nosebleeds all the time,
and suddenly, we Blip back,
and he's totally ripped and super nice and all these girls are after him.
Not all the girls are after him. No, man, they're all after him.
Yeah. Here.
Anyway, on to more important things.
It's a nine-hour flight. We can play Beast Slayers the whole time.
Are you excited?
I need your help to sit next to MJ.
Seriously? Yes, seriously.
What about our plan? American bachelors in Europe.
That's your plan. That's a solo plan. Come on, this is my plan.
Please.
Hey, guys.
There's an old lady in front of us wearing a crazy amount of perfume,
and it's kind of setting off Peter's allergies.
Betty, if you could switch seats with him, that would be
He's allergic to perfume?
Yeah, yeah, because it
It makes his eyes water,
and he can't really Peter has a perfume allergy?
From experience, perfume allergies are no joke.
I can feel hives breaking out already. MJ, stand up.
Ned, take MJ's spot. MJ, you take my spot.
Peter, let's get you out of there.
Sorry. Zach and Sebastian,
you take Ned and Peter's seats. That's all right.
Ned, thanks for bringing this to my attention.
Your safety is my responsibility. And Mr. Dell's, but he's
I got it for now. Let's go, Peter!
Let's go!
Yeah, I have a small bladder, so I took the aisle.
So did you want to play Beast Slayer?
Nope.
Have you ever played any kind of PC game or?
No. Got it.
Did I tell you how my wife pretended to Blip out?
Turns out, she ran off with a guy in her hiking group.
We had a fake funeral for her.
Well, the funeral was real because I thought she was really dead.
Wanna see the video?
Oh, I got a dual-headphone adapter if you want to watch a movie.
Only if it's depressing. Or hilarious.
Oh, you have a dual-headphone adapter. We can watch together.
Good afternoon, this is your captain speaking.
Our flight time will be eight hours, 49 minutes to Venice, Italy.
Nice picture.
Hey, did you see Brad and MJ on the plane?
They were watching movies and laughing the entire time.
Dude, don't worry, okay?
I'm sure that's nothing. Hey, babe.
Can you hold this?
Yeah, of course. Thanks.
What was that?
Well, we got to talking on the plane, and it turns out,
we have a lot in common.
So we're boyfriend and girlfriend now.
Whatever happened to being an American bachelor in Europe?
Peter, those were the words of a boy.
And that boy met a woman.
A very strong and powerful woman.
And now that boy's a man.
Babe? Coming, babe.
There's nothing in there. I swear.
These, no.
Sorry. Sorry.
I'm here. Mr. Harrington. Wait, wait, wait.
I'm here, I'm here. Oh, thank goodness.
Looks like we're here. They're doing renovations to the place.
Getting some upgrades. Oh, this is trash.
That must be the concierge. Okay.
Come on, man.
Everyone, here we are.
Tell me we're not staying here. Come on in.
This place is sinking.
You mean, "charming." It stinks.
Okay, everybody, drop your bags off.
We're gonna meet at the da Vinci Museum at 3. Let's go!
¡Vamonos! It's "andiamo."
Andiamo! There you go.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
When you're in Venice, your socks get wet.
What's up, Flash Mob? How you guys doing?
I'm here in St. Marco Polo's
This is so much fun. Yeah?
Three, two, one. Say "pizza."
Pizza! Pizza time!
Hi.
I'm looking for a
It's perfect.
What?
The most perfect word. Italians created it, I just discovered it.
What does it mean? It can mean a million things.
"I don't know." "Get out of my face."
"I don't know" and "Get out of my face."
It's the best thing Italy created, except for, maybe, espresso.
Oh, so you've been drinking espresso.
Hey. German? American.
A rose for you.
"Boh" is my new superpower.
It's like the anti-"aloha." I was born to say this word.
So, what's in the bag?
Nice.
Whoa, cool.
What was that?
Betty! You okay? Yeah.
Oh, my God! Come on.
Guys, we gotta go!
What is that? I don't know.
What'll you do? Left my suit in the hotel.
Why? I'm on vacation, Ned!
Everyone will see my face. Get them out of here.
Go! Just go!
Get out of here. Go!
Oh, my God.
Come on.
Oh, no, you don't.
You okay? Get out of here. Go!
Excuse me, sir!
I I can help. Let me help.
I'm really strong, and I'm sticky.
I need to lead it away from the canals.
The da Vinci Museum. This is why we're here in Venice.
Oh, this is it.
It's closed.
What do you mean? Till when?
November.
You didn't check the website? Oh, that's a good idea.
Oh, come on.
Stay low, kids. We'll be safe here.
Who is that guy?
I don't know, but he's kicking that water's ass.
Yeah! Yeah!
It's aliens. It has to be.
BuzzFeed says there's a sailor named Morris Bench
who was exposed to an experimental underwater generator
and got hydro powers.
Yeah, you should definitely believe everything you read on the Internet.
Spider-Man could take him. What do you think it is?
Being a man of science
witches.
No, no, no. We wanna stay.
Good thing I packed your suit.
I can't believe you forgot it. Yeah.
So who was that guy that you were with? Was that Mr. Strange?
Doctor Strange, May. Doctor Strange. And, no, I don't know who that was.
It was a new guy.
I was trying to help him Happy, that's my lunch.
Don't eat that one.
Happy's there? Yeah, it's Happy.
He's here. He came by to volunteer.
And he's hanging around the office.
And he wants to say hi. I don't want Hi, Peter.
Hey, Happy.
Sorry, I'm working hard here. I gotta do a A leaflet drop.
What are you doing? Glad you're having a good time.
Don't worry, I'm really taking care of your aunt.
So how's the plan going?
There's been setbacks, for sure.
Don't overthink it. Trust your instincts and you'll be fine.
I know. Love you.
Bye.
Who is that guy?
He's like Iron Man and Thor rolled into one.
He's all right. He's no Spider-Man.
What is it with you and Spider-Man?
What? He's just awesome, okay?
He protects the neighborhood and he's inspiring.
He inspires me to be a better man.
What's up, dickwad? Thought you drowned.
Sounds like his name's Mysterio.
"L'uomo del misterio" is Italian for "man of mystery."
They don't actually know who he is. Mysterio.
Cool name. Cool name.
Babe. Babe.
So how much of that did you see?
Not much. I was running.
Right. Me too. I was also running
away.
So Paris tomorrow.
Go to the Eiffel Tower. Should be great.
Yeah, I read it was secretly built as a mind-control antenna
to create an army of the insane.
Which is why it's my favorite destination on the whole trip.
What are you gonna do about the water monster?
Nothing.
It's dead. Besides, that Mysterio guy's all over it.
I just wanna spend some time with MJ.
We were talking about Paris, and I think she really likes me.
That's nice.
Reminds me of when Betty and I first fell in love.
I had just finished my fruit cobbler, right, and
You're a very difficult person to contact, Spider-Man.
You're Nick Fury.
And you just shot Ned.
It's a mild tranquilizer. He'll be all right.
So good to finally meet you.
I saw you at the funeral,
but I didn't think that was a good time to exchange numbers.
That would've been inappropriate.
That's what I just said. Right.
The important thing is, you're here. I tried to bring you here.
You avoided me, and now you're here.
What a coincidence.
Wait. Was this a coincidence?
I used to know everything.
Then I come back five years later, and now I know nothing.
No intel, no team.
And a high school kid
is dodging my calls.
Here's what I do know:
A week ago, a village in Mexico was wiped out by a cyclone.
Witnesses say that cyclone had a face.
Three days later, a similar event in Morocco.
A village was
Just making the rounds.
See if anyone needs any counseling after today's traumatic events.
No, we'll be okay. We're fine. Thank you.
Great because I'm I'm not qualified to actually
Oh, he's passed out.
I'm not qualified to do it anyway, so good night.
That was my teacher. Sorry about that. You were saying?
A village was destroyed by what may well be another world-threatening
Babe, you still awake? You're not answering any of my texts.
He's asleep, Betty.
Oh, already?
Yeah. Okay.
That's why it's imperative
Hey, boys. So that canal water today was filled with dangerous bacteria
Another person touches that door, we are going to attend another funeral.
Suit up. Let me know if you develop vomiting.
Stark left these for you.
Really?
"Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown."
Stark said you wouldn't get that because it's not a Star Wars reference.
You can lose the mask. Everyone here has seen you without it.
You'd be feigning anonymity
and breathing through spandex for no good reason.
Come on.
Yeah.
Over there, we have Maria Hill.
That is Dimitri.
And this is Mr. Beck.
Mysterio?
What?
Doesn't matter. It's just what my friends have been calling you.
Well, you can call me Quentin.
You handled yourself well out there today. I saw what you did with the tower.
We could use someone like you on my world.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. Your world?
Mr. Beck is from Earth.
Just not yours.
There are multiple realities.
This is Earth Dimension 616. I'm from Earth 833.
Sorry, you're saying there's a multiverse?
I thought that was theoretical.
That changes how we understand the initial singularity.
We're talking about an eternal inflation system.
How does that even work with all the quantum?
It's insane.
Sorry. It's really cool.
Don't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room.
Anyway
They were born in stable orbits within black holes.
Creatures formed from the primary elements:
Air, water, fire, earth.
The Science Division had a technical name.
We just called them Elementals.
Versions of them exist across our mythologies.
Turns out, the myths are real.
Like Thor.
Thor was a myth, now I study him in my physics class.
These myths are threats.
They first materialized on my Earth many years ago.
We mobilized and fought them,
but with each battle, they grew, got stronger.
I was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them.
All we did was delay the inevitable.
The Elementals are here now, attacking the same coordinates.
Our satellites confirm it.
Thank Mr. Beck for destroying the other three.
There's only one left: fire.
The strongest of them all. The one that destroyed my Earth.
It's the one that took my family.
I'm sorry.
And it will be in Prague in approximately 48 hours.
We have one mission: kill it. And you're coming with us.
I'm sorry, did you say Prague?
Mr. Fury, this all seems like bigtime, you know, huge superhero kind of stuff.
And I'm just a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, sir.
Bitch, please. You've been to space.
I know, but that was an accident.
There's gotta be someone else you can use.
What about Thor? Off-world.
Okay, Doctor Strange.
Unavailable. Captain Marvel.
Don't invoke her name.
Sir, look, I wanna help. I do.
But if my aunt finds out I left my class trip, she'll kill me.
And if I'm seen in Europe after the Washington Monument,
my class will figure out who I am, then
Then the whole world will figure out who I am, and then I'm done.
Okay.
I understand.
I'm sorry, what?
Why don't you get back before your teachers miss you
and become suspicious.
Dimitri.
Take him back to the hotel, please.
Yes.
Thank you, Mr. Fury.
And good luck.
See you, kid.
Yeah, see you.
Bye, ma'am. Yeah.
Drink lots of water. I'm gonna get you a vitamin C pill.
You cannot get sick, okay? Okay. Thanks, baby.
Hey, are you sure you're good?
Oh, dude, I'm fine.
Okay. Nice. Don't worry.
Getting tranq'd in the neck by Nick Fury,
probably the coolest thing to ever happen to me.
It is pretty awesome. Yeah.
I'm happy I don't have to go to Prague. Seriously.
Good news. We're going to Prague.
What? Prague?
Yeah. Tour company called. They upgraded us.
You should've heard me on the phone with them. I really gave them hell.
All I heard was crying.
Look at our upgraded ride. Whoa, bro, you see that?
It's pretty sick.
I'm impressed, Mr. Harrington. Oh, come on.
Peter, what? What's going on?
I think Nick Furyjust hijacked our summer vacation.
I'm Mr. Harrington to the kids
Oh, all right. Okay.
Awesome.
Yeah. Awesome.
Yo, what's up, Flash Mob? It's your boy, the Big F,
cruising through the Alps with my private driver, Dimitri.
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you.
Say EDITH."
Stand by for retinal and biometric scan.
Retinal and biometric scan accepted. Hello?
Hello, Peter.
I am EDITH,
Tony Stark's augmented-reality security and defense system.
So he made you for me? No.
But you have access to all of Tony's protocols.
Cool. Would you like to see what I can do?
EDITH stands for "Even dead, I'm the hero."
Tony loved his acronyms.
Yeah, he did.
I have access to the entire Stark Global Security network,
including multiple defense satellites,
as well as back doors to all major telecommunication networks.
Is MJ texting?
No. Don't look at it. Don't look at it. That's wrong. That's wrong.
Petrol and toilets. Ten minutes!
Flash Mob, this is what we doing out here
Toilet, toilet, toilet. Which way to the toilet?
Ten minutes, everyone.
Dimitri, where exactly are we?
Okay. I'll figure it out. Oh, my gosh, it's so sick.
It's beautiful.
What?
Hello.
Close the door.
I'm Peter Parker.
Take off your clothes.
Excuse me? You told Fury
Spider-Man cannot be seen in Europe.
So I made you this, another suit.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure it fits fine. I don't need to try Take off your clothes.
Okay.
Sure.
It's a little embarrassing. Now. Hurry up.
This is weird.
No, no, no. Don't
Sorry. I thought this was the bathroom. This is not what it looks like.
Just Yeah.
What are you doing? I'll leave you alone.
Oh, my God. Don't shoot anybody. Brad? It's not what it looks like, buddy.
Hey, man, look, that's Look, Peter,
I'm not here to judge your life choices, dude.
If you want to hook up with some random European chick, that's on you.
That's not what that was. I can't pretend I didn't see what I saw.
I know you're trying to get with MJ. It's obvious.
But I like her too. Wait a minute. Hey, hey.
You cannot show her that photo, dude. I'm sorry, man. I have to.
She deserves the truth.
Okay, put your one foot in front of the other,
and, everybody, back on the bus.
It's been 10 minutes. Let's go!
What's up, Flash Mob? It's your boy, Big F
EDITH? Hello, Peter. How can I help you?
Hey. There's this guy in my class who's gonna ruin everything with MJ
Peter, I'm having difficulty hearing you. Can you please speak up?
Brad Davis. He has a photo of me.
Brad Davis. Is he a target?
Is Brad a target?
Yeah. He's a target. He's a target. Copy that.
Target is Brad Davis. Initiating strike.
Initiating what, now? Intercept point determined.
Releasing kill vehicle. EDITH.
Oh, my God. Dope glasses, Parker.
How'd you pay for these? Flash, give them back.
I'm really paying you a compliment. Please give me
I'm so sorry.
EDITH, don't kill Brad. Do you want me to cancel
the drone strike on Brad Davis? Did you punch Flash?
No. Firing.
Oh, look out!
Hey, this is not the autobahn!
EDITH. Harrington!
Is this the autobahn? Appears to be.
Commencing second strike. Peter.
Plant your fanny and buckle up now. Look at the baby mountain goats!
Baby mountain goats? I see them.
I don't see any mountain goats.
You missed them.
I know you think none of us have noticed, Peter
What?
but your new look, I love it.
Right, babe? Thanks.
Yeah. Sophisticated, classy, very European.
Oh, man.
Let's try that again.
This is so weird. It was right here on my phone.
I Yeah. Weird.
Whoa, freaking beautiful. This is amazing.
Wow, this place is so classy.
Yeah, so why are we here?
Speak for yourself.
I'm home.
What can I say?
The squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease.
Everyone get settled, rest up because tonight, big surprise,
is Prague's annual Carnival of Lights.
Yeah! Hello?
Parker, it's Hill. There's an earpiece with your suit.
Put it on and await further instructions. Understood?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah. Hey, man.
Hey. Look, I am so sorry
if I seem like I'm preoccupied with my relationship.
I'm still your guy in the chair. No, it's all good. Don't worry about it.
Okay. Great, great. It's fine.
So, what's the status on the Elemental thing?
Where's it gonna happen? Here in the city.
We're here. I know. It's not good.
I'm figuring it out.
You have to do something, please. We're counting on you.
Ned. Yeah. Yeah, babe.
The good news is, we've all got our own rooms.
It's about time. Serious?
Parker? Parker!
Yes, sir.
That thing is going to be here in a few hours.
Are we boring you?
He's not bored. He's thinking about how you kidnapped him.
He had obstacles.
I removed them.
They still won't evacuate the city.
Idiots.
So, what's the plan, Parker?
I will be in the cathedral tower, keeping watch for the fire monster.
When that shows up, I will radio you guys,
and then Mr. Beck and I will My name is Mysterio.
That's when Mysterio and I will move in.
Peter, listen to me.
The best hope you have, the only hope,
is to stop it here now, no matter what the cost.
Maneuver it away from civilians if you can,
but most important, keep it away from metal.
If it gets too big, it'll draw power from the Earth's core.
After that, there's no way to stop it.
Hey, my friends are here.
I can't help but think we're putting them in danger.
You're worried about us hurting your friends?
You, who called a drone strike on your own school tour bus?
Stark gave you a multibillion-dollar A.R. tactical intelligence system,
and the first thing you do with it is try and blow up your friends.
It's clear to me that you were not ready for this.
Fury asked me to come up here and see how you were doing.
He just He felt bad about snapping at you.
Really?
You guys do have sarcasm on this Earth, right?
How you feeling?
I didn't think I was gonna have to save the world this summer.
I know that makes me sound like such a jerk. I just
I had this plan with this girl that I really like
and now it's all ruined.
You're not a jerk for wanting a normal life, kid.
It's a hard path.
You see things. You do things. You make choices.
People look up to you
and even if you win a battle, sometimes they die.
I like you, Peter. You're a good kid.
There's a part of me that wants me to tell you, just
turn around, run away from all this.
Then there's another part of me that knows what we're about to fight,
what's at stake, and I'm glad you're here.
Me too.
But you're worried about your friends.
Yeah.
Just always feel like I'm putting them in danger.
Look, just get them inside and keep them in a safe place for just a few hours.
They'll be all right.
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to about superhero stuff, you know?
Anytime.
And, hey, we survive this, you'll have all summer to kill Brad.
See you out there.
All right.
Sorry, that's Italian.
Okay. EDITH? Oh, come on.
Hello, Peter. Hey.
I need a way to keep my friends inside the next few hours.
Let's see what we can do.
Good news.
We're going to the opera!
You're kidding me. The opera?
Don't look at me. What happened to the carnival?
This is upgrade living.
Come on. The tour company just gave us these tickets.
For free! Do you have any idea how much opera tickets cost?
No, because none of us have ever wanted to go to the opera, ever.
I think this is gonna be culturally enriching for us.
Thank you, Ned.
Everyone, this is gonna be, maybe,
the best four hours of our whole trip.
Four hours?
Guys, I think this is gonna be really fun. Seriously.
I bet now you're all happy I had you pack a nice outfit.
Yeah, because we'd much rather go to a four-hour opera
instead of the biggest party in the world.
Again, don't look at me.
Parker, do you copy?
Comm check, one, two.
Okay, here we are. Beat the rush.
Yeah, the rush out.
Lucky for us, we got the best seats in the house.
Let's go.
Hey. I'll save you a seat.
You look really pretty. And therefore, I have value?
No, that's not what I meant at all. I was just
I'm messing with you.
Thank you. You're welcome.
You look pretty too. Thank you.
Oh, my gosh! Opera glasses! So cute.
Can I? Yeah.
Want to go in on a pair?
You mean, sit next to each other? Yeah.
Are you in position?
No. Okay. No
Why the hell not? Parker? you don't want to sit next to me,
or, no, you just don't want the glasses? I didn't mean that.
If you go ahead, I'll go grab us a pair.
I'll save you a seat next to me.
A lot of seats, so I'll be up there. Awesome.
Okay.
Parker. No, I'm coming. I'm
Hey, I gotta go. Could you tell MJ that I'm sick or something?
Okay. Be careful.
And whatever you do,
please steer the monster away from the opera house.
Yeah, Ned, I know.
Okay. Okay?
Yeah. Gotta go.
Parker! You better be on your way.
Coming.
Where do you think she's going? To the carnival?
Oh, I I don't We should go. Yes, we should go.
Come on, let's go. Come on.
All right. I'm in position.
As soon as I see something, Beck, I'll I'll let you know.
Roger that. How's the suit?
The suit's great.
It's awesome. It's a little tight around the old web-shooter.
Parker! Okay, I'll shut up.
Oh, my God, babe, isn't this beautiful?
Yeah, it's real beautiful, babe.
What's wrong? You know, honestly, I just
I don't do well with big crowds, so maybe we should
I have the perfect thing. Come on.
Don't worry, babe.
We'll get away from the crowds, get some fresh air.
You'll feel a thousand times better.
Energy spiking. We have seismic activity.
Okay, he's here! Beck, you ready?
You know what to do. On your lead, Spider-Man.
No, come back!
Come back and help us!
You're up, kid.
Wait, wait. Is that?
Do you think that's Spider-Man?
No, no, no. It's a European rip-off version of him.
I actually read about him. It's not him.
No, Beck! He's got the carousel!
He's getting bigger!
What's his name? What's his name?
It's Night Night Monkey.
Night Monkey? Yeah.
Yeah. Night Monkey!
Yeah. Night Monkey. Night Monkey, help!
Save us! Night Monkey, we're stuck! What?
Oh, no, no. Help us! Help!
Are you okay?
On to Plan B?
Yeah! We gotta hit him with something he can't absorb!
I go left, you go right! Now!
Okay, shoot him!
Yeah!
That hurt him. Keep it coming.
Spider-Man, keep your distance.
I'm trying!
Can't let him get near the Ferris wheel.
Okay. I'm on it!
Whoa, what is that?!
Betty! Betty!
That's it! Nice! Nice! You got him!
No, no, no.
It's too late.
Whatever happens
I'm glad we met.
Beck, what are you doing?
What I should have done last time.
Beck, don't do it!
Beck!
Mr. Beck?
Oh, thank God.
I would kiss you, but I think I threw up in my mouth a little.
I might have a mint.
So it's over?
That was the last of them.
But not the last threat we'll ever face.
We need to stay vigilant.
There's a void in this world for someone like you.
Hill and I are going to Europol headquarters in Berlin tomorrow.
You should join us.
Thank you. I just might take you up on that.
You got gifts, Parker, but you didn't wanna be here.
Mr. Fury, I I'd love to have you in Berlin too.
But you got to decide whether you're going to step up or not.
Stark chose you.
He made you an Avenger.
I need that.
The world needs that.
Maybe Stark was wrong.
Was he?
The choice is yours.
Let's get a drink.
I'm not 21.
Hey.
You gotta celebrate. We did something good tonight.
Yeah.
Fury was right.
Tony did a lot for me
so I owe it to him, to everybody.
Do you?
Yeah. I mean
Mr. Stark gave me the chance to be more.
He wanted me to be better than him.
And Fury wants me to live up to that. What do you want?
What do you mean? What do you want?
I don't know. What do you want? Peter Parker. Now.
I know you're thinking about it. I wanna go on my trip.
I want to go back on my trip with my friends.
And go to the top of the Eiffel Tower
with the girl who I really like and tell her how I feel
and give her a kiss.
Shut up, man.
You're not gonna do that, are you? No, I can't.
Why not?
Because I have too much of a responsibility.
My God. Thank you so much. What are those?
Are those the? EDITH glasses, yeah.
They were just on the floor? Try them on. Let's see how they look on you.
Yeah? Yeah.
I actually really like them.
Can I be completely honest with you? Please.
They look really stupid.
But maybe they have a contact-lens version.
You try them on.
No, come on. Try them on.
I don't wanna try them on. Just put them on.
What do you think, kid?
"Next Tony Stark, I trust you."
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."
What?
Stark left me a message with those glasses:
"For the next Tony Stark, I trust you."
I'm still not following. How many lemonades have you had?
He knew every mistake I ever made.
He must've known I wasn't ready for something like this.
Why give it to you?
Maybe he didn't trust me to have EDITH, he just trusted me to pick who should.
It makes much more sense. He knew I'd do what's right.
And he's not gonna give them to Fury because Fury would give himself EDITH.
You're probably right.
Right, so the world needs the next Iron Man.
And it's not me. I'm a 16-year-old kid from Queens.
It needs to be an adult with some experience
and that's good like Tony Stark, like you.
No. Peter, come on. No.
EDITH? Hello, Peter.
Hi. Yeah
I'd like to transfer your control over to Quentin Beck.
Peter, what are you doing? Doing the right thing.
Any transfer will require confirmation. Stark gave you the glasses.
Stark gave me a choice. It's my choice to make, okay? And I'm gonna make it.
You're a soldier, a leader. You stopped the Elementals.
You saved my life. You saved the world, okay?
He'd want you to have them.
Waiting for confirmation.
Confirm.
Welcome to the Avengers.
They look good on you.
Thank you.
It's an honor.
Yeah.
Mr. Stark would've really liked you.
Where you headed?
I'm gonna go find MJ. Good luck, kid.
I'll give you a fifty-fifty chance. You're pretty awkward.
Yeah.
See you later, man. See you.
See? That wasn't so hard.
Yes!
Somebody get this stupid costume off me!
Okay, we got EDITH.
Get these connected to our system.
Toast! Toast! Toast!
No, this is a big win, but we still got a lot of work to do.
Toast! Toast! Toast!
Yeah!
Okay, toasts!
Give me that, Doug.
To the man who brought us all together, our former boss, Tony Stark.
The jester king.
Literally wrapped in wealth and technology
that he was unfit to wield.
Like the holographic system I designed.
A revolutionary breakthrough with limitless applications
that Tony turned into a self-therapy machine
and renamed
Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF.
Oh, $611 million for my little therapeutic experiment.
He renamed my life's work "BARF."
I told him it was a mistake,
that my technology could change the world.
And then
he fired me.
Said I was
unstable.
To Tony. To Tony!
Next, to William. William!
Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave!
With a box of scraps!
The integration of my illusion tech
with your weaponized drones was brilliant.
Powerful illusions, real damage, worked like a charm.
And it's just the beginning.
Thank you, brother. To Guterman.
Guterman! To Guterman!
The story you created of a soldier from another Earth named Quentin
fighting space monsters in Europe is totally ridiculous
and apparently the kind of thing people will believe right now.
I mean, everybody bought it.
Gutes! Guterman!
To Victoria. To Victoria!
Staging electromagnetic pulses at each attack site
so Fury's own satellites would confirm our lies.
Inspired idea.
To Janice. Janice!
After Tony died, she was the one who discovered that EDITH
was being handed over not to us, not to the Defense Department,
but to a child.
Thank you. To Janice!
And to the rest of you, Tony Stark is gone.
There is a window of opportunity, and someone will step up.
But these days, you can be the smartest guy in the room,
the most qualified, and no one cares.
Unless you're flying around with a cape or shooting lasers from your hands,
no one will even listen.
Well, I've got a cape and lasers.
With our technology and with EDITH,
Mysterio will be the greatest hero on Earth!
Yeah!
Then everyone will listen!
Not to a boozy man-child. No!
Not to a hormonal teenager.
No!
To me
and to my very wealthy crew.
To us. To us.
To Mysterio! To Mysterio!
To Peter Parker. To Peter Parker!
Poor kid.
Let's get to work.
Peter, oh, my God. Hey. Hey.
We almost died. It's fine. It's fine.
Hey, I'm done with the mission.
Dude, the trip's over. What?
There's monsters coming out of the ground.
Of course our parents want us home.
Don't put me on hold. Peter, you're not dead.
Oh, my God. Yes, good. Stay here. Don't Put some clothes on.
We're booking flights.
We came for science, we're leaving because of witches.
Welcome to the new Dark Ages.
What is going on? We're going home in the morning.
No, no. All the Elementals are gone.
Ned. Coming, sweetie.
Hey, can you guys keep it down? I'm live-streaming.
Yeah. Hey.
Hey. Where were you?
I got lost. We were worried about you.
Good thing you're back. Yeah.
So much for Paris. It would've been fun.
Yeah. Night. Night.
You look ni
Okay.
Hey. Hey.
Look
I'm not ready for this trip to be over yet, and I kind of want to do something fun
that's not on the itinerary or planned or with Mr. Harrington.
Yes.
"Yes," like you wanna go?
Yes.
Awesome. I'll see you outside in 10 minutes.
Meet me outside in five minutes.
Five is good. Okay.
Okay, bye. Bye.
Night Monkey, help us! Help! Night Monkey!
Hey. Hey.
Where do you wanna go?
Who cares? Awesome.
Okay. Let's go.
I'm glad we're doing this. Yeah, me too.
To see the city a bit.
They used to execute people on this bridge.
They would put them in a basket, and they would drown in the water.
Sorry. It's okay.
There's this thing I've been wanting to talk to you about
for a while.
Yeah?
It's our last night in Europe,
and I had this plan that I wanted to tell you.
I'm just gonna tell you.
MJ, I "I'm Spider-Man."
What? That's what you were gonna say.
That you're Spider-Man.
No. I'm not Spider-Man.
I've been watching you for a while now.
It's kind of obvious.
I'm not Spider-Man.
What would make you think that I was Spider-Man?
Peter, Washington? Yeah?
The fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason.
No, I was sick. Remember? I had my The tummy?
Susan Yang thinks you're a male escort.
What? Of course I'm not a male escort.
Then you're Spider-Man. I'm not Spider-Man at all.
What about tonight? You snuck off, and you fought that thing. I saw you.
You can't have seen me because I'm not Spider-Man.
Also, on the news, it was the Night Monkey.
The Night Monkey? Yeah.
That's what it said on the news,
and the news never lies.
Night Monkey. Okay. What are you doing?
Well, do the Night Monkey and Spider-Man use the same webs?
I mean, maybe.
Maybe he's a Spider Monkey. Who knows?
Were you only watching me because you thought I was Spider-Man?
Yeah.
Why else would I be watching you?
Doesn't matter. Just thought that maybe
What the hell was that?
I don't know.
What is it, some kind of projector or something?
Yeah, but it's really advanced.
It It looked so real.
It Yeah, really real.
Wait, does that mean that? The Elementals are fake?
That doesn't make any sense because we were there, right?
There was fire and destruction, and
Who would do something like that?
Mysterio.
I am Spider-Man.
And I've really messed up. Wait. You're being serious?
You're 100 percent serious? Because it's not funny.
No, I'm not joking.
Because I was I was only like 67 percent sure.
MJ So why are you here?
Why are you on this school trip? I know you have a lot of questions,
but we have to get out of here, okay?
Okay. Okay. I can't believe I figured it out!
You took everything from me!
This is for my family!
Pause.
Pause.
Sorry.
Yeah, can you just fast-forward to the end?
Yep. Stand by.
All right, fly, fly, fly, zap, zap, zap.
Pause. I'm not in love with this choreography, but it'll do.
Kill image.
De-cloak drones.
All right, weapons.
You want to weaponize? Yep.
Weapons only. Stand by.
Nice. Stop.
Something. I don't know what it is. It's something
Just dou You know what? Double the damage and then run it again.
You want me to double it up?
Yeah. All right.
Cover your ears.
That is good! That's good.
We on schedule? Oh, yeah.
Uploading software hack to EDITH network.
With her drones, we'll create an event big enough to cover an entire city.
All right, well done.
Make sure every drone is weapons-hot. We need maximum damage.
That is gonna cause a lot of casualties. Oh, yeah.
More casualties, more coverage. I gotta cut through the static.
London is a beautiful city, and it will suffer, but they can rebuild.
If I'm the next Iron Man,
I need to save the world from an Avengers-level threat.
But when its new savior descends,
all those casualties will be forgotten.
Janice, you'll be in position with my quick-change armor for the victory lap?
Of course. Do you wanna try?
No, no, that's What's going on with my hand?
Why is that happening?
Oh, one of the drones that came back from the plaza was missing a projector.
It's fine.
Wait, and you're? You're telling me this now?
It's It's one drone.
The image will be perfect, I promise. That projector is evidence.
It's going to tell people what we're doing and how we're doing it.
I am trying to fool 7 billion people here, including Nick Fury,
who happens to be the most paranoid and most dangerous person on the planet.
If he catches on before I've killed him, he will put a bullet in my head.
And nobody wants a bullet in their head, right?
Right?
William, can you look at me?
Pull up EDITH.
Hello, Quentin.
Hi, honey. I need a level-five search, full-resource protocol for this device.
Magnifying.
There. Search everything going in and out of that building.
Located.
Shit.
You know, William, one day,
after I've had to kill Peter Parker because of this,
I hope you remember that his blood is on your hands!
I can't believe I gave Beck those glasses. How could I be that stupid?
He's probably spying on me right now or sending a drone to come and kill me.
You had access to killer drones?
Yeah, I didn't really want them, especially after I almost killed Brad.
You almost killed Brad?
Look, I have to call Mr. Fury and tell him that Beck's a fraud
but I think he tapped my phone. So, what are you gonna do?
I need my suit, and I have to go to Berlin
and talk to Mr. Fury in person.
Just
Oh, Ned, perfect.
The costume looks great
for the costume party at the prince's castle.
She knows. I told her.
He didn't tell me. I figured it out.
That's cool. Like, a long time ago.
Look, Mysterio is a fraud. But he saved me and Betty's lives.
He's been faking the whole thing with illusion tech.
Yeah, he's using these, like, hologram projectors.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
So you guys were working the case together or what?
It's been mostly me.
Ned, I need you to call May, get her to call Mr. Harrington,
say she wanted me to stay with family in Berlin, okay?
Got it. Easy.
Wow, you guys lie with such ease.
I gotta go. Wait, wait, wait. The projector.
You're gonna need this.
Don't tell anyone about this, okay? Anyone who knows is in danger.
So you know too.
It's cool.
I've known first, and I've known longer, but it's not a competition.
Excuse me. Do you know where? Nacht Monkey!
No, wait, I didn't Oh, man.
Get in.
Mr. Fury You've got a lot of explaining to do.
No, no, no, listen. Wait until we're secure.
Okay.
Right.
So is there anything you want to tell us about your girlfriend?
He's talking about EDITH.
I know I made a mistake, and I'm sorry, but he is not who you think he is.
Beck is a liar. Mysterio, the Elementals, it's all fake.
He has some sort of illusion tech.
That's how he tricked you and tricked me into giving him EDITH.
It's a projector. I pulled it off the fire monster in Prague.
So all that death and destruction we witnessed
was created by this?
No, not just this. I think he's using drones.
Well, if this is true, then Beck's very dangerous and we need to be smart.
Who else did you tell about this?
Parker? Parker!
What's wrong? It's Beck. He's here.
What? Hill?
No, it's just an illu
Fury!
Wow, Peter, wow.
I thought we were close.
Fury always had to die, but not you.
Stop hiding, Beck!
I tried to help you walk away.
Now you're making me do this.
You told me, you were just a kid.
You told me, you wanted to run after that girl.
Help me! MJ!
Oh, God!
Peter, what's going on? I know this isn't real.
Do you, though?
MJ! MJ!
I don't think you know what's real, Peter.
You need to wake up!
I mean, look at yourself.
You are just a scared little kid in a sweat suit.
I created Mysterio to give the world someone to believe in.
I control the truth.
Mysterio is the truth.
If you were good enough, maybe Tony would still be alive.
Deep down, you know I'm right.
You made your choice. And all you had to do was step aside.
And now you have
Fury.
Beck's people are trying to find everyone who could expose him.
Who'd you tell?
I know you told someone, so just tell me.
Okay. Who did you tell?
Who else did you tell?! Just Ned and MJ from my class.
Maybe Ned told his girlfriend Betty, but that's it.
What?
You are so gullible.
What? You're smart as a whip.
Just a
sucker.
And now all your friends have to die. Oh, my God.
It's easy to fool people when they're already fooling themselves.
But for what it's worth, Peter,
I really am sorry.
EDITH. Yes, Quentin.
Access files to Peter Parker's class trip.
I need them to fly home from London.
Hi.
Where am I?
Municipal holding facility.
They said they found you unconscious at the train yard. Very dangerous.
And we gave you the shirt because you seemed a bit cold.
Thanks.
You guys are nice.
You speak really good English.
Welcome to the Netherlands.
I'm in the Netherlands right now? Yep.
Bye.
Guard!
The guard is on a break. Probably talking to his wife.
Yeah, she's pregnant. Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Night Monkey. Yeah.
You guys okay?
Excuse me, sir? Yeah?
Could I borrow your phone? Yeah.
Everyone is so nice here.
Okay.
Okay.
Pick up, pick up, pick up. Hey, hey
I messed up. I need a I need a ride.
Where am I? Where am I, sir?
It's Broek op Langedijk.
Hang on. Could you say that into there?
Hi. It's Broek op Langedijk here.
Yeah, no problem.
Thanks.
Did you get that?
Peter? Are you okay?
Happy, is that you? Yeah, of course it's me.
Stop! Tell me something only you would know.
Only I would know
Remember when we went to Germany?
You pay-per-viewed a video in your room?
They didn't list the titles, but I could tell by the price it was an adult film.
And you didn't know how I knew Okay, fine! It's you. Stop.
It's so good to see you.
You'll have to tell me what the hell is going on here.
Okay, hold still.
There we go.
Ouch.
I thought you had super strength. It still hurts.
Happy, come on. All right, relax.
Just a few more. There we go. Oh, my God, Happy.
Relax. Don't tell me to relax, Happy!
How can I relax when I messed up so bad?
I trusted Beck. Right?
I thought he was my friend. I gave him the only thing Mr. Stark left for me,
and now he's gonna kill my friends and half of Europe,
so please do not tell me to relax.
I'm sorry, Happy. I'm sorry. I shouldn't shout.
I just really miss him.
Yeah, I miss him too.
Everywhere I go
I see his face.
And the whole world is asking who's gonna be the next Iron Man
and I don't know if that's me, Happy. I'm not Iron Man.
You're not Iron Man.
You're never gonna be Iron Man.
Nobody could live up to Tony.
Not even Tony.
Tony was my best friend.
And he was a mess.
He second-guessed everything he did. He was all over the place.
The one thing that he did that he didn't second-guess was picking you.
I don't think Tony would have done what he did
if he didn't know that you were gonna be here after he was gone.
Now, your friends are in trouble, you're all alone, your tech is missing.
What are you gonna do about it?
I'm gonna kick his ass.
But I mean, right now. Specifically, what are we gonna do?
Because we've been hovering over a tulip field for the last 15 minutes.
Right. I can't call my friends because he's tracking their phones.
Give me your phone.
My cell phone? Yeah.
Okay. Here.
What's your password? "Password."
No, what is your password? "Password," spelled out.
Head of security, and your password is "password"?
I don't feel good about it either.
Hello, governor. Cup of tea for you? I'm gonna be in London soon.
They're in London. London, okay.
Yeah, I need a suit. Suit?
Okay
bring up everything you have on Spider-Man.
Yeah, open that. Okay, no, no, no.
What?
Nothing.
You take care of the suit. I'll take care of the music.
Oh, I love Led Zeppelin.
Okay, can you pull up my web-shooters?
Isolate the Taser webs, and reconfigure and boost the voltage
to a factor of 25 percent,
and give me complete manual control over detonation.
I thought Kree having sleeper cells was top secret information.
Nick, satellites are picking up an EM pulse.
I thought that was over. It's the biggest one yet.
Where? London.
Okay, the company set up a city tour,
and then we'll grab a bite and head to the airport.
Is no one else going to acknowledge how crazy this is?
Oh, yeah, I get it.
There's been nothing scientific about this science tour at all.
No, I'm talking about Peter.
Has no one noticed how shady he is?
Because I saw him in the back room of a rest stop with some woman
in his underwear, and he's always sneaking away,
like back at the opera, huh?
Now he's suddenly off the trip, with his family in Berlin?
Is no one else interested in the truth?
"The very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world."
George Orwell.
Thank you, MJ. Yeah.
Well, since Peter's not really here to tell his truth, what about you, Brad?
Why take pictures of people in the bathroom?
Yeah, what's that about?
No, no, no, it wasn't like that. It was
I was trying to take a Let's just put all this craziness behind us
and have a nice, peaceful afternoon.
"Sounds great, Mr. Harrington," said the class.
Okay.
I'm gonna be a cool teacher right now.
You gotta stop doing that. It is weird.
No more photos in the bathroom. Urinal or stalls.
Okay? Look at this, guys.
Mr. Harrington, this is your bus.
We got a bus all to ourselves. Nice to see you all. Come along.
I'll get this, yeah? Why not? Thank you.
Yeah. Thank you, brother.
All right.
I have the kids.
I got here as fast as I could.
I did a full perimeter sweep. Nothing.
Damn it.
Pulse is spiking.
I'll take another look. Soon as you see something, report.
You're all we've got, Beck.
If this is what I fear, then God help us, Fury.
God help us all.
Okay, people, no Avengers coming. Good to go.
William, launch the drones. Copy that, brother.
Drones are entering the atmosphere weapons-hot.
Excellent. Janice? Working on the cape.
Get those wrinkles out. I could be shaking hands with the queen.
Guterman? Almost in position.
Okay. Hit it, Victoria. Increasing pulse.
Whatever this thing is, it's 100 times bigger than the previous ones.
EDITH?
Yes, Quentin.
Show me my loose ends.
Once the show's going, execute the kill order on my command.
Copy. All right.
Start the show.
Let's save the world, people.
I don't like this. Something's definitely up.
You're an FOS now. "Friend of Spider-Man."
And you have to remember, just stay calm.
That doesn't look good.
But it's fake, there's nothing to worry about.
And the kids are in the kill zone.
Great work, Guterman.
What? Happy Hogan here.
I know. What do you want? Over at Mr. Stark's,
going through his belongings.
There was a surfboard you left behind. What?
People there said they didn't think Nick Fury was a surfer, but I said:
"Appearances can be deceiving." It's not mine. And don't ever call again.
Fury's got the coded message. Your friends are at the Tower Bridge.
Your boy called it London Bridge, but I figured it out.
I'll scoop them up, okay? Yeah.
We're close. We're close.
How's the suit? Almost done.
Good. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Before you go
if something happens to me, could you please give this to MJ?
You'll make it back. You'll give it to her yourself.
Okay? You got this. I got this.
Walk me through it. I know it's illusion tech.
All I have to do is get inside the illusion, then I can take it down,
find him, and he's just a guy, so I can take EDITH right back.
Right, but last time, you got hit by a train.
True, but this time
How do I explain this? I have a sixth sense.
The Peter-tingle. That's what you're talking about, right?
It's not working, though.
I heard it wasn't working right now. Is it? It is working.
I don't know if it's working So you got the Peter-tingle.
That's the plan. I'm gonna go get your friends.
You get that Peter-tingle back online. I got this.
Cue the lightning. Cuing lightning.
Sir, is it still safe on the top, or should we all come down?
Oh, my.
What did the bus driver say? Bus driver's gone.
What?! Where?!
It's okay. Mr. Dell and I have it under control!
Oh, no. Don't drag me into this, Roger. I'm doing my best, Julius!
Look Oh, the witches are back.
Oh, my God, get off the bus!
Okay. Okay, follow me, kids.
Come on, let's go!
Now, that is an Avengers-level threat.
This way. This way!
Okay. Okay. Oh, my God!
Flash! Follow that cursed hand.
This way, kids. Follow me.
It's not real, it's not real! It looks real to me!
Follow me, kids!
Earth, wind, fire, water.
Oh, no. Theyjoined forces like the Power Rangers.
You're thinking of Voltron. Who?
Voltron! You're thinking of Voltron!
Hey, look, it's Mysterio!
He's gonna save us!
If Mysterio knows we know
Then we're in danger. Yeah, and so are they.
We should go.
Kill that witch!
This is for my family!
Get somewhere safe, Fury.
I don't see this ending well.
I appreciate your concern, but I never leave my men behind.
All right, comms check. Can you hear me, kid?
I can. It's a little loud out here. I like the new suit.
Thanks. Whoa, Peter, you sure that's not real?
Yeah, it's just 100 times bigger than I expected.
Still the play?
We need to get high enough so Beck doesn't see me coming.
Copy. Stay sticky.
Hey, Happy. Yeah, kid. What is it?
We need to have a serious conversation about you and my aunt!
Beck, report!
Guterman, I need a response. Something quick and decisive.
"It's all the Elementals. They're merged into something"
into something else. Something more powerful.
It's drawing energy from the Earth's core.
See, now, that's some bullshit.
Is that?
Be ready for anything.
Yeah.
It's not real, it's not real, it's not real!
That's awesome.
William, I've got drones breaking formation.
Maybe they hit a flock of birds. You're fine.
I wanna see what's happening Taking manual control.
Do you see anything?
Yeah. And I'm gonna kill him.
I hope this works.
You got me?
I got you.
Boss, the illusion is coming apart.
I see you.
EDITH, give me protection. Copy.
Just kill the illusion. Kill it. I'm not gonna kill it. They'll see.
They'll see what I want them to see!
Do you still need the cape? Yes, Janice.
I still need the cape. Done.
William, render my illusion suit. All right, hang on.
The monster was full of drones! It's crazy!
There you are.
Easy.
Who the hell is that?
Ned! Happy!
I gotta get you guys out of here! Get on the jet!
Who are you? I work with Spider-Man, okay?
Get on that jet. You work for Spider-Man?
I work with Spider-Man, not for Spider-Man.
New plan. Into the Tower. What?
Happy, are you okay? We're okay. Just get Beck.
EDITH, target Spider-Man. Copy.
I'll just kill the kids myself.
There you are.
Into the Crown Jewels vault!
Yeah, go, go, go! Come on.
Go! Into the vault! The walls are 8 feet thick.
Go into the vault!
What? Into the vault. Go!
Take cover!
Okay.
Yeah?
No. No.
I see you.
Get that thing out
Go!
How does Cap do that?!
Happy, say something, to let me know you're alive!
I'm here. I'm here. Happy, thank God.
I bought us some time.
But not much. I'm trying to get to Beck,
but I can't shake these drones!
Gotcha.
Going up!
Finally.
Hey, William, how we doing? Illusion almost back up.
I don't know how you're gonna spin this.
Oh, great. No webs.
Are we gonna die? Nobody dies on my watch.
I wasted my life playing video games, and we're gonna die.
I have a fake ID, and I've never even used it.
I post stupid videos daily for people to like me.
Hey, if it wasn't for those stupid videos,
Spider-Man would've never found you.
Spider-Man? Spider-Man follows me? I saved us, guys.
If you saved us, why are we about to die?
MJ! Stop it!
I'm sorry, okay?
I'm obsessed with telling the truth even if it hurts people's feelings.
I'm in love with Spider-Man's aunt.
We're sharing, right?
Your lies are over, Beck.
This certainly isn't ideal, but I have contingencies.
EDITH?
Just give me the glasses.
You want these?
Come and get them.
Come on, Peter-tingle.
Why aren't these drones firing? You're in the strike zone.
The chance of getting hit is No, fire all the drones now!
Beck!
Beck.
You lied to me.
I trusted you. I know.
That's the most
disappointing part.
You're a good person, Peter.
Such a weakness.
Stark was right.
You do deserve them.
You can't trick me anymore.
EDITH, turn off the drones.
Biometric scan complete. Welcome back, Peter.
Execute all cancellation protocols? Just do it.
Execute them all. Confirmed.
Give me the spear.
That's a halberd.
Thank you.
How could you do all of this? You'll see, Peter.
People, they need to believe.
And nowadays
they'll believe anything.
Is he?
Is this real?
All illusions are down, Peter.
Yeah!
Hey, where you going?
MJ. Hey.
Hey. Hey.
Are you okay? I'm okay. Are you okay?
Yeah. Yeah. Is everybody else okay?
Yeah, everyone's okay.
What happened? There was just the drones,
and they were following us, and then theyjust stopped.
Was that you? Yeah.
Did you get him?
Yeah. Well, I
brought that.
In case you needed some help.
Thanks.
Anyway, there was this sweaty guy in the tower with us.
I think he works for you or something.
He
He gave me this. No.
No.
Oh, MJ, I'm so sorry.
I had this stupid plan. Peter.
I wrote it down, I was gonna buy you this and give it to you in Paris at the top
And you kissed me.
What? What? Yeah.
I don't really have much luck when it comes to getting close to people.
So I lied.
I wasn't just watching you because I thought you were Spider-Man.
That's great.
Black dahlia, like the murder. The murder.
Good. Yeah.
Sorry it's broken.
I actually like it better broken.
I really like you.
I really like you too.
Okay. I should
I should probably get back to the class.
I'll go and
Yeah. I don't know. Okay.
Just in case.
Yeah, no.
No, May, you're right. He did great. He was strong.
Yeah. I'm glad he stayed too.
I gotta go.
I'm glad you're alive. I guess the coded message worked.
"Appearances can be deceiving."
I'm surprised you didn't just wink in the camera.
It worked.
Only because I had serious doubts about Beck from the beginning.
Not true. He had zero doubts.
Where's Parker?
He's with a girl.
I need to speak with him.
He'll call you. He'll?
Okay. Great.
Well, he better.
Or it's your ass.
And don't even think about ghosting me.
Are you sure no one else has figured it out?
Yeah, it's not like anybody really pays attention to you.
Ouch.
Except for me.
Thanks.
Don't be late. I won't.
See you later.
You guys are so cute. Thanks.
I was thinking we should all go on a double date or something.
Oh, we broke up. Oh, we broke up.
No. What? Why?
Men and women grow apart,
but the journey they share together will always be a part of them.
You are so wise. Thank you.
Hello, Gerald.
Could Mother not make it?
May! I promise you
Oh, he's here. Don't give me a ticket.
I'm so glad you're okay.
No, for real, I'm good. I'm actually really fine.
Let's go. Where are your bags?
Oh, right. They got blown up. Yeah.
I got you some hot buttered bagels. Thank you so much.
I know my boy.
I kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years.
I faced a lot of deception.
And I'm tired of the lies.
So it's time for the truth to be out there.
Are you dating?
Yes. Not really.
What? Well
I think Summer fling.
Yes, that evolves and grows like any other.
I still don't know where it's going to go. Open to wherever it might lead.
Anywhere. On or off. To share it with people
We'll always be friends, no matter what. I'm gonna go because I've got a date.
because we all are interconnected.
Bye. We are.
Sorry!
Hey. Sorry I'm late. Hey.
It's fine. You ready?
Yeah. You're gonna love this.
Okay! Okay!
Okay. Okay. You ready?
Yeah. I'm just not gonna watch. I'm not gonna watch.
I should stop looking. I'm gonna stop looking!
Okay. You can put me down now! You can put me down now!
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.
Let's just Never, never doing that again.
I'm never doing that again. Okay.
I should probably get out of here.
Be safe. See you later.
This is breaking news.
We come to you with revelations about last week's attack in London.
An anonymous source provided this video.
It shows Quentin Beck, aka Mysterio, moments before his death.
A warning, you may find this video disturbing.
I managed to send the Elemental through the rift,
but I don't think I'm gonna make it.
Spider-Man attacked me for some reason.
He has an army of weaponized drones, Stark technology.
He's saying he's the only one who's gonna be the new Iron Man, no one else.
Are you sure you want to commence the drone attack?
There will be significant casualties. Do it. Execute them all.
This shocking video was released earlier today
on the controversial news website TheDailyBugle.net.
There you have it, folks, conclusive proof that Spider-Man
was responsible for the murder of Mysterio,
an interdimensional warrior who gave his life to protect our planet
and who will no doubt go down in history
as the greatest superhero of all time.
But that's not all, folks.
Here's the real blockbuster. Brace yourselves.
Spider-Man's real Spider-Man's real name is
Spider-Man's name is Peter Parker.
What the fu?
You gotta tell him.
It was fine.
The little boy handled it.
We helped.
Talos. Come off it.
How was I supposed to know that the whole thing was fake?
I mean, that was all very convincing.
The performances, the illusion, that costume, the craftsmanship in that.
This is just embarrassing for a shape-shifter. Fine.
Hey there. I hope your mission is going well.
We gave the glasses to Parker about a week ago, like you said.
And it was very touching, you know?
Really, really quite touching.
Talos.
And, you know, shortly after that,
it really kind of went off the rails, and so we need you to come back
because everyone kept asking where the Avengers are,
I don't know what to say to that,
so you're lucky that Spider-Man won
Everybody back to work!
Who's got my shoes?

Things are never gonna be the same now.
I mean, look at this.
You got aliens.
You got big green guys tearing down buildings.
When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.
Actually, it's native American, but whatever.
Yeah. Tell you what, though.
It ain't bad, is it?
No. Yeah.
Kid's got a future.
Yeah, well,
we'll see, I guess.
No, hey! Ah!
You can't saw through that stuff.
These alien bastards are tough.
You gotta use the stuff they use.
See? All right. All right.
Oh, hey!
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.
Yeah. My alarm didn't go off. Yeah, your alarm.
Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you.
This is a huge deal for us.
Attention, please!
In accordance with executive order 396b,
all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.
Who the hell are you?
Qualified personnel.
Look, I have a city contract
to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so...
I apologize, Mr. toomes, but all salvage operations
are now under our jurisdiction.
Please turn over any and all exotic materials
that you've collected or you will be prosecuted.
Ma'am, what am...?
Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on.
Look...
I bought trucks for this job.
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family. I have a family.
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.
What'd you say?
Yeah.
He's right. I overextended myself.
- Hey, hey, hey. - Don't do it.
Ah-ah-ah-ah. Put 'em down.
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?
A joint venture between stark industries
and the federal government, the department
of damage control, will oversee the collection
and storage of alien and other exotic materials.
Now the assholes who made this mess are paid to clean it up.
Yeah, it's all rigged.
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material
scattered throughout the tri-state area.
Hey, chief!
We still have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?
I ain't hauling it. It's too bad.
We could have made some cool stuff from all that alien junk.
I tell you what.
Let's keep it.
The world's changing.
It's time we change too.
There you go, Mason.
Yeah!
Business is good.
- New York. Queens. - It's a rough borough,
- but, hey, it's home. - Who you talking to?
No one. Just making a little video of the trip.
- You can't show it to anyone. - Yeah, I know.
Then why are you narrating in that voice?
Uh, because it's fun. Fun.
So why do they call you happy?
Come on. I'm not carrying your bags. Let's go.
Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?
There's a bathroom on it.
Whoa. No pilot? That's awesome.
Is that where you're gonna sit? Yeah.
This is your first time on a private plane?
My first time on any plane.
Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?
Shh, shh, shh.
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.
Something about captain America going crazy.
- This is you. - Oh, we're neighbors?
We're not roommates. Suit up.
Okay, Peter, you got this.
What the hell are you wearing?
It's my suit.
Where's the case? What case?
What? I thought that was a closet.
- This is still my room? - Go. Please.
My room is way bigger than... There.
- I found the case. - I found the case.
"A minor upgrade"?
Whoa.
Oh, my god.
Put it on. What the...?
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...
Let's go. But I don't understand.
Is it for me? Happy. Happy, wait.
This is insane. Insane.
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.
The greatest day of my life. Let's go. Come on.
- Okay, there's captain America, - iron man, black widow.
- Whoa. Who's that new guy? - Underoos!
Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.
Hey, everyone.
Okay, so the craziest thing just happened.
I just had a fight with captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...
What the hell? He's big now. I gotta go. Hang on.
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. stark was like, "hey, underoos!"
I flipped in and stole cap's shield.
I was like, "what's up, everybody?"
And then... hey, just a second!
Coming!
Hey.
We have thin walls here.
What are you doing, a little video diary?
- Yeah. - It's all right.
- I'd do the same thing. - I told him not to.
He was filming. I'm gonna wipe the chip.
Okay. Hey. You know what?
We should make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?
An alibi? Sure. Okay. We rolling? Get in the frame.
Hey, may. How you doing?
What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.
Three, two, one. Hey, may.
My gosh, I wanted to tell you
what an incredible job your nephew did
this weekend at the stark internship retreat.
Everyone was impressed.
- Come on! - It's a freaking merge. Sorry.
Because you're not on queens boulevard.
See, happy is hoping
to get bumped up to asset management.
He was forehead of security, before that he was a driver.
That was a private conversation.
I don't like joking about this. It was hard to talk about that.
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?
- Here we are. End of the line. - Whoops.
Can you give us a moment? Want me to leave the car?
Grab Peter's case out of the trunk.
I can keep the suit?
Yes, we were just talking about it.
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything stupid.
I've seen his cardiogram.
All right? Yes.
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything i wouldn't do.
There's a little gray area in there. Where you operate.
Wait, does that mean I'm an avenger?
No.
- This it? - Seventh floor.
I can take that. You don't have to.
You'll take it? Yeah, I can take that.
Thank you.
So when's our next...?
When's our next "retreat," you know?
What, next mission?
Yeah, the mission. The missions.
We'll call you. Do you have my numbers?
No, I mean, we'll call you.
Like, someone will call you. All right?
From your team. Okay. All right.
That's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.
Bye.
They're gonna call me.
What's up, penis Parker?
Rise and shine, midtown science and technology.
Students, don't forget about your homecoming tickets.
Do you have a date for homecoming?
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.
Okay. Yeah.
Damn it. You, in my office right now.
Join me, and together
we'll build my new lego death star.
- What? - So lame.
No way. That's awesome. How many pieces?
Three thousand eight hundred and three.
That's insane. I know.
You want to build it tonight?
No, I can't tonight. I've got the stark...
Mm-hm. Stark internship. Yeah, exactly.
Always got that internship.
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.
That would be so sweet. Right?
He'd be all, "good job on those spreadsheets, Peter.
Here's a gold coin."
I don't know how jobs work. That's exactly how they work.
I'll knock out the basic bones of the death star at my place.
I'll come by afterwards.
For the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it.
The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.
That'd be great.
I'm gonna be late!
Okay, so how do we calculate
linear acceleration between points a and b?
Flash.
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by the mass.
Nope. Peter.
You still with us?
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah.
Uh...
Mass cancels out, so it's just gravity times sine.
Right. See, flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.
You're dead.
Today we're talking about Danish physicist niels bohr,
but trust me, there's nothing bohr-ing
about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.
- Did Liz get a new top? - No.
We've seen that before, but never with that skirt.
- Liz, hey. That looks so good. - Hi!
We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy.
Too late. You guys are losers.
Well, then why do you sit with us?
Because I don't have any friends.
Let's move to the next question.
What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?
Hydrogen's the lightest.
That's not the question. Okay. Yeah.
Uranium.
That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.
Yes. Open your books to page 10.
Peter, it's nationals.
Is there no way you could take one weekend off?
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. stark needs me,
I have to make sure I'm here.
You've never been in the same room as Tony stark.
Wait. What's happening?
Peter's not going to Washington.
No. No, no, no. Why not?
Really? Right before nationals?
He already quit marching band and robotics lab.
I'm not obsessed with him. Just very observant.
Flash, you're in for Peter.
- I don't know. - I gotta check my calendar first.
I got a hot date with black widow coming up.
That is false.
What'd I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?
Hey, what's up? Hey, man.
What's up, Mr. delmar?
Hey, Mr. Parker.
Number five, right?
Yeah, and with pickles,
and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.
You got it, boss.
How's your aunt?
Yeah, she's all right.
Ten dollars. It's $5.
For that comment, $10.
Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.
Here's $5.
What's up, murph?
How you doing, buddy?
So how's school?
Ah, you know. It's boring. Got better things to do.
Stay in school, kid. Stay in school.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.
This is great. Best sandwiches in queens.
Finally.
- Excuse me. - What's the matter with you?
Could you hold this for a second? Thanks.
Hey, is this anybody's bike? No?
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike? - I have no change.
Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?
Everybody good?
Hey!
You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?
Call me spider-man!
Okay, spider-man. Do a flip.
Yeah! Not bad.
Hey, buddy.
Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad. It's my car, dumbass!
Hey! Shut that off!
Can you tell him it's my car? I was just...
Yo! I work at nights. Come on. That's not your car!
That's his car. How was I supposed to know?
He put that in the window! Every day with these alarms!
Turn it off! Don't make me come down there.
Hey, Gary! How you doing?
Marjorie, how are you? How's your mother?
I'm good, I'm good.
You have reached the voicemail box of:
Happy hogan.
- Hey, happy. - Here's my report for tonight.
I stopped a grand theft bicycle.
Couldn't find the owner, so I just left a note.
Um...
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.
She was really nice and bought me a churro.
I just feel like i could be doing more.
You know? Just curious when the next
real mission's gonna be.
So, yeah, just call me back.
It's Peter. Parker.
Why would I tell him about the churro?
Oh. Unh. Hey, hey. Oh! Ah.
Okay.
Can't wait to see this thing.
Finally, something good.
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.
- Told you it was worth it. - Okay, go, go, go.
Oh, heh, nice.
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.
Ahem. What's up, guys?
You forget your pin number?
Whoa! You're the avengers.
What are you guys doing here?
Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.
I thought you'd be more handsome in person. Iron man.
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You're a billionaire.
Hey...
Oh, this feels so weird.
What is that thing?
I'm starting... To think... You're not... The avengers.
911. What's your emergency?
Uh, spider-man is fighting the avengers
in a bank on 21st street.
- All right, let's wrap this up. - It's a school night.
So how do jerks like you get tech like this?
No. Wait, wait, wait! Ah!
Mr. delmar.
Hey, Mr. delmar, you in here? Is anybody in here? Hello?
Oh, come on.
I gotta...
Here, here. Good, yeah.
Okay. Good. Yes.
Yes... no. No, put that down.
That's worth more than you or me. Yeah?
Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me.
These guys were robbing an atm
with high-tech weapons... Take a breath. I don't have time
for atm robberies yeah, but...
Or the notes you leave behind.
I have moving day to worry about.
Everything's gotta be out by next week.
Wait, wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
Yeah, don't you watch the news?
Tony sold avengers tower.
We're relocating to a new facility upstate
where hopefully the cell service is much worse.
But what about me? What about you?
Well, what if Mr. stark needs me or something big goes down?
Can I just please talk to Mr. stark?
Stay away from anything dangerous.
I'm responsible for making sure you're responsible, okay?
I am responsible. I... oh, crap.
My backpack's gone. That doesn't sound responsible.
I'll call you back. Feel free not to.
What was that?
Uh, it's nothing. Nothing.
You're the spider-man.
From YouTube. I'm not. I'm not.
You were on the ceiling. What are you doing in my room?
May let me in. We were gonna finish the death star.
You can't just bust into my room!
That Turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.
Let's go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want thai?
Yes. No. He's got a thing.
A thing to do after.
Okay.
Maybe put on some clothes.
Oh, she doesn't know? Nobody knows.
Mr. stark knows because he made my suit. That's it.
Tony stark made you that? Are you an avenger?
Yeah, basically.
Oh, geez. You can't tell anybody.
You gotta keep it a secret.
Secret? Why? You know what she's like.
If she finds out people try and kill me
every night, she won't let me do this.
Come on, ned, please.
Okay, okay, okay.
I'll level with you.
I can't keep this a secret.
It's the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.
Ned, may cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now.
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, i... please.
Okay. Just swear it, okay?
I swear.
Thank you. Yeah.
I can't believe this is happening now.
Can I try the suit on? No.
How's it work? Magnets? How do you shoot the strings?
I'm gonna tell you tomorrow. Great.
Okay, well, wait, then.
How do you do this and the stark internship?
This is the stark internship.
Ohh...
Just get out of here.
What's the matter?
Thought you loved larb.
It's too larby?
Not larby enough.
How many times do I have to say "larb" before...
You talk to me?
You know I larb you.
I'm just stressed. The internship, and I'm tired.
A lot of work.
The stark internship.
I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony stark.
You're distracted all the time. He's got you in your head.
Delmar's sandwiches destroyed...
What does he have you doing?
You need to use your instincts.
After an atm robbery was thwarted
by queens' own crime stopper, what?
The spider-man.
As the spider-man attempted to foil their heist,
a powerful blast was set off,
slicing through the bodega across the street.
Miraculously, no one was harmed.
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
Six blocks away from us.
I need a new backpack.
What? I need a new backpack.
That's five.
Sticky rice pudding. We didn't order that.
It's on the house.
Oh. Thanks.
That's nice of him.
I think he larbs you.
You got bit by a spider?
Can it bite me?
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?
Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I'd let it bite me.
Maybe. How much did it hurt?
The spider's dead, ned.
Whoa.
You were here?
Yeah.
You could've died.
Do you lay eggs?
What? No.
Can you spit venom? No.
Can you summon an army of spiders?
No, ned.
The sokovia accords were put into place...
How far can you shoot your webs?
It's unknown. Shut up.
To begin regulating...
If I was you, i would stand on a building
and shoot as far as I could... Shut up, ned.
Hi. I'm captain America.
Whether you're in the classroom or on the battlefield...
Do you know him too? Yeah, we met.
I stole his shield. What?
Today, my good friend, your gym teacher
will be conducting the captain America fitness challenge.
Thank you, captain.
Pretty sure he's a war criminal, but I have to show these videos.
It's required by the state. Let's do it.
Do avengers have to pay taxes?
What does hulk smell like?
- I bet he smells nice. - You have to shut up.
Is captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?
Ned, just shh, okay?
Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?
What?
Yeah. You know how there's a guy with a headset
telling the other guy where to go?
If you're in a burning building, i could tell you where to go.
There'd be screens around me, and I could swivel around.
I could be your guy in the chair.
Ned, I don't need a guy in the chair.
Looking good, Parker.
Now, see, for me, it would be f Thor
marry iron man and kill hulk.
Well, what about the spider-man?
It's just spider-man.
See the bank security cam on YouTube?
He fought off four guys.
Oh, my god, she's crushing on spider-man.
No way.
Kind of. Oh, gross.
He's probably, like, 30.
You don't know what he looks like.
What if he's seriously burned?
I wouldn't care. I'd love him for the person he is inside.
Peter knows spider-man.
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...
They're friends.
Yeah, like coach Wilson and captain America are friends.
I've met him, yeah. A couple times.
But it's...
Through the stark internship.
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed to talk about it.
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?
Maybe you should invite him to Liz's party. Right?
Yeah, um, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.
- Having a party? - Yeah, it's gonna be dope.
You should totally invite your personal friend spider-man.
Um... It's okay.
I know Peter's way too busy for parties anyway, so...
Come on. He'll be there. Right, Parker?
What are you doing?
Helping you out.
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.
Dude, you're an avenger.
If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it's you.
House party in the suburbs.
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.
It'll be a night to remember. Oh...
Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.
Yeah, it gives me confidence. Hm.
This is a mistake.
Hey, let's just go home.
Oh, Peter.
I know. I know it's really hard
trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.
It's flowering now.
He's so stressed out lately.
What helps with stress is a party.
We should go to the party.
Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.
Peter...
Have fun, okay? Okay. I will.
Bye, may.
Dude, you have the suit, right?
Yeah. This is gonna change our lives.
Annie, over here!
Hey. Hey.
Dj flash.
Okay. We're gonna have spider-man swing in,
say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.
Can't believe you're at this lame party.
But you're here too.
Am I?
Oh, my gosh.
Hey, guys. Cool hat, ned.
Hi, Liz. Hi, Liz.
I'm so happy you guys came.
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.
What a great party. Thanks.
Oh, i...
My parents will kill me if anything's broken. I gotta...
Yeah. Have fun.
- Bye. - Bye.
Dude, what are you doing?
She's here. Spider it up.
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.
Spider-man is not a party trick, okay?
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.
Peter, no one wants that.
Dude.
Penis Parker, what's up?
So where's your pal spider-man?
Let me guess: In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?
That's not spider-man.
That's just ned in a red shirt.
"Hey, what's up? I'm spider-man.
"Just thought I'd swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter.
"Oh, what's up, ned? Hey, where's Peter, anyways?
He must be around..."
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?
What the hell?
Whoo!
This sucks.
Whoo!
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-ultron arm straight from sokovia.
Here. You try.
Man, I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?
Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.
Okay, I got black hole grenades, chitauri railguns...
You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up.
Look, times are changing. We're the only ones
selling these high-tech weapons.
Oh, this must be where the atm robbers got their stuff.
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.
I got antigrav climbers.
Yo, climbers?
Okay, what the hell is that?
Did you set us up? Hey, hey, man.
Hey! Come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.
All right.
What was that?
What...?
We gotta call him. No, no, no, no.
Did you just do it again?
Shut up. I'm calling him.
Toomes's phone.
Boss.
Oh, my butt!
Great. Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.
Hey, hey, buddy.
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.
Whoo!
Now, this is more like it.
Whoa!
Smells really good.
Great movie!
Oh, hey, guys.
No! No!
- Hey, it's Peter. - Leave a message.
Peter, where are you?
The hat's not working. This is not cool.
Almost got you.
Thought you got away from me, didn't you?
I got you right where I want you.
Surprise!
What the hell?
Oh, hey.
And then he just, like, swooped down like a monster
and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.
How'd you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit?
I put everything in your suit.
Including this heater.
Whoa.
That's better. Thanks. What were you thinking?
The guy with wings is the source of the weapons.
I gotta take him down.
Take him down now, huh?
Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.
The avengers? No, no, no.
This is a little below their pay grade.
Mr. stark, you didn't have to come out here.
I had that. I was fine.
Oh, I'm not here.
Thank god this place has Wi-Fi
or you would be toast right now.
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.
Cheers.
Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.
Why? Why?
Because I said so!
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.
Stay close to the ground.
Build up your game helping the little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.
Can't you just be a friendly
neighborhood spider-man?
But I'm ready for more than that now.
No, you're not. That is not what you thought
when I took on captain America. Trust me, kid.
If cap wanted to lay you out, he would've.
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call happy.
Are you driving?
You know, it's never too early to start thinking about college.
I got some pull at mit. End call.
No, I don't need to go to...
Mr. stark is no longer connected.
That's awesome.
"Stay close to the ground"? What is he talking about?
Whoa.
Hey, man, what's up? I'm on my way back.
Actually, i was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen to this.
When I say "penis," you say "Parker."
- Penis! - Parker!
- Penis! - Parker!
- Sorry, Peter. - I guess we're still losers.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll see you tomorrow in school.
Whoa.
Idiots.
Idiots.
Idiots!
Boss? Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.
What'd I tell you about looking at my phone?
Oh. Sorry. You left it out.
You know I'm a curious person by nature.
I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.
Huh? In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.
Ha, ha, ha! Whoo!
I mean, that was badass.
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?
You said, move the merchandise. Under the radar.
Under the radar!
That's how we survive.
If you bring damage control
or the avengers down here, we're through.
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars calling yourself the shocker.
"I'm the shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?
Whatever, old man. Come on.
Look.
Look.
I know you don't give a crap about anything.
But I do.
I built this whole place
because I got people i have to look after.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.
Get out of here. What?
You're done. You're off the crew.
Yeah, all right.
Heh. All right.
Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right?
With everything I know.
Excuse me? I'm just saying,
maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.
You know what? What?
You're right.
That work? I don't know.
I can't afford that.
W-w-wait.
Damn.
I thought this was the antigravity gun.
What? No, that's that one.
Here.
Now you're the shocker.
Go out there and find that weapon he lost.
All right.
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.
Yeah, well, something came up.
Oh, what is that?
I don't know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.
Seriously? Yeah.
Awesome.
I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy.
So scary. Yeah.
Well, look, I think it's a power source.
Yeah, but it's connected to all these microprocessors.
That's an inductive charging plate.
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.
Whoever's making these weapons
is combining alien tech with ours.
That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said.
I just want to thank you
for letting me be part of your journey
into this amazing...
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.
I gotta figure out what this is and who makes it.
We'll go to the lab after class and run some tests.
Let's do it.
First, we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.
We gotta come up with a better name than "glowy thingy."
You're right.
Crap.
Come on, come on, come on.
High schools creep me out.
They got this funny smell, you know what I mean?
Hey, that's one of the guys that tried to kill me.
What? Yeah.
We gotta get out of here.
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.
They can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.
Someone dropped you in a lake? Yeah, it was not good.
Peter... No. Stay there, ned.
Peter.
What are you doing?
Nothing.
Yeah. You good?
Chess.
Man, can you imagine what the boss would say
if he knew where we were?
It's saying there was an energy pulse here.
There's no sign of the weapon.
And even if it was here, now it's gone.
So are we.
This is so awesome.
I know, right?
They're in Brooklyn.
Staten island.
Leaving Jersey.
They stopped.
Huh.
Maryland?
What's there? I don't know.
Evil lair?
They have a lair? Dude, a gang with alien guns
run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.
Badass.
But how are you gonna get there if it's, like, 300 miles away?
It's not too far from D.C.
Hey, it's Peter. Guys.
- Peter? - Hey, buddy.
Yeah, I was hoping I could rejoin the team.
No, no way. You can't quit on us,
stroll up and be welcomed back by everyone.
Hey, welcome back, Peter!
Flash, you're back to first alternate.
What? He's taking your place.
Excuse me, can we go already?
I was hoping to get in some light protesting
in front of one of the embassies before dinner.
Protesting is patriotic. Let's get on the bus.
Focus up, everyone.
Our next topic is the moons of saturn.
Second law of thermodynamics.
Frank Sinatra. Fort sumter.
Flash is wrong. Okay, guys, let's focus.
Next one. Liz, don't overwork 'em.
Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.
Glad to be back.
What is the current standard unit of...?
Can I take this real quick? I'll only be a sec.
Yeah, fine. Hello?
Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?
Okay, focus up, everyone. Tracker.
Yeah, it's just a school trip. It's nothing.
Look, happy, I gotta say,
you tracking me without permission
is a complete violation of my privacy.
That's different. What's different?
Nothing. Look, it's just the academic decathlon.
It's no big deal. Hey, hey.
I'll decide if it's no big deal.
Sounds like it's no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.
Everyone stick together. Yeah.
You kidding me? This place is huge.
I've seen bigger. There's a bird in here.
Hey, you brought your laptop, right?
Why?
Peter,
why are we removing the tracker from your suit?
Uh, because i gotta follow these guys
to their boss before they move again
and I don't really want Mr. stark to know about it.
So you're lying to iron man now?
No, I'm not lying.
He just doesn't really get what I can do yet.
Oh, gotcha.
All right, happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.
There's a ton of other subsystems in here.
Hm?
But they're all disabled by the training wheels protocol.
What?
"Training wheels protocol"?
Turn it off.
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.
Come on, man, i don't need training wheels.
I'm sick of him treating me like a kid all the time.
It's not cool. But you are a kid.
Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.
Peter, I just don't think this is a great idea.
I mean, what if this is illegal?
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.
I can handle it. Ned, come on.
I really don't think this is a good idea.
The guy in the chair.
Don't do that. Come on.
The glowy thing, it's evidence. Keep it safe, all right?
Okay. Okay.
They're moving. Be careful.
Hey, Liz. Perfect timing.
We're gonna go swimming.
Come on, come on. What?
Hey, Peter. Hi.
Hey.
I was... I was gonna go study in the business center.
Peter, you don't need to study.
You're, like, the smartest guy I've ever met.
And besides, a rebellious group activity
the day before competition is good for morale.
Hm?
Well, I read that in a Ted talk, so...
I... I heard it in a Ted talk.
And I read a coaching book.
Are you really... This is really important to you.
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.
So get your trunks on and come on.
Come on.
Come on. I'm coming, I'm coming.
Let's go.
Good evening, Peter.
Hello? Hello?
Congratulations on completing
the rigorous training wheels protocol
and gaining access to your suit's full capabilities.
Ah, thank you.
So, where would you like to take me tonight?
I put a tracker on someone. He's a bad guy.
Tracker located.
Plotting course to intercept target.
Okay, well, as long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.
One hundred meters from destination and closing.
Jump now.
Detecting three individuals.
Why is their secret lair
in a gas station? That's so lame.
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?
Do you want to hear what they're saying?
I can hear what they're saying? Uh, yeah.
Activating enhanced reconnaissance mode.
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design. Whoa, that's so cool.
Can't believe they're still cleaning the triskelion mess.
- I love it. - They keep making messes,
- we keep getting rich. - Target inbound.
Whoa, they're in the middle of a heist.
I could catch 'em all red-handed. This is awesome.
Okay, I'm gonna get a little closer
so I can see what's happening.
Would you like me to engage enhanced combat mode?
"Enhanced combat mode"? Yeah.
Activating instant kill.
No, no, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.
Deactivating instant kill.
Did you hear that?
What the hell just happened? What was that?
You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.
Suit lady, what's wrong with my web-shooters?
Rapid-fire is the default for enhanced combat mode.
Why would I need rapid-fire?
Would you like to see more options?
You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.
Mr. stark really overdid it.
You two wait right here.
Wait. You're gonna want to turn on the dampers
or that thing will shatter your arm.
All right, where's the dampers?
That one. Great choice.
Would you like me to set this as your new default?
No, no, no. Push that in.
Right here? No, the other...
This one here? Yeah, push it.
What was that? Taser webs.
Taser webs? I don't want taser webs.
You seem to be unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings.
Would you like to run a refresher course?
No. Just... you choose. Sure thing.
Six-Alpha-niner, are you running on time?
Copy, central. Six-Alpha-niner on schedule.
I got a visual. Green light, green light.
Oh, that's him.
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.
Pulling in behind the caboose.
Deploy anchors.
Dropping down.
No outgoing distress signals. You're all clear.
Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.
Whoa, cool.
It's like some kind of matter phase shifter.
All right, coming up.
Hey, big bird! This doesn't belong to you.
Oh, god.
Suit lady, what was that? You told me to choose.
What? No, just set everything back to normal.
Activating all systems.
Oh, my head.
You appear to have a mild concussion.
Hey, so where am i right now?
I'm not sure.
The container walls are hindering my sensors.
Wait a minute.
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have to fight
our way out of this one.
Three, two, one!
What is this place?
Suit lady, where am I?
You're in the most secure facility
on the eastern seaboard.
The damage control deep storage vault.
No. Seriously?
The door will most likely remain closed until morning.
Morning?
Hey, suit lady, i kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady," you know?
I think I should probably give you a name...
Like Liz. No, no, no.
God, that's... That's weird.
What about Karen?
You can call me Karen if you would like.
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?
What?
Maybe we should run that refresher course.
Ricochet web. Ricochet web.
Whoa! Cool. Splitter web.
Web grenade. Web grenade!
Should I tell Liz that I'm spider-man?
Who is Liz?
Who's Liz? She's... heh.
She's the best. She's awesome.
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And, uh...
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?
"Hey, I'm... I'm spider-man."
What's weird about that?
What if she's expecting someone like Tony stark?
Imagine how disappointed she'd be when she sees me.
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.
Thanks, Karen.
It's really nice to have somebody to talk to.
Hey, how long we been here anyways?
Thirty-seven minutes. What?
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.
There's got to be something in here I can use.
Okay, let's see.
Nope.
That's awesome.
Ah. Hey, it's like the glowy thing.
That glowy thing is an explosive chitauri energy core.
Whoa, whoa! You mean, we've been carrying around a bomb?
It would require radiation to transform it
into an explosive state.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey!
Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.
Trial unsuccessful.
Okay, we're just gonna have to try every sequence.
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late. Come on, let's go.
Okay. Hold on, hold on.
Initiating trial 247.
It worked. It works!
Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.
Thank you.
Karen, get me to the decathlon as fast as possible.
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.
Across from the Washington monument.
It's ned. Leave a message.
Ned, call me back! The glowy thing's a bomb!
There's a vehicle approaching on your right.
We have now entered sudden death.
The next correct answer wins the championship.
Midtown tech?
Zero.
That is correct.
Midtown takes the championship!
Whoo-hoo! - We won!
You guys, i am so proud of you.
Told you we didn't need Peter.
Flash, you didn't answer one question.
Taking it all in? Oh, yeah, I just...
Um, I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.
I'm sure the Washington monument wasn't built by...
Okay.
Enjoy your book. Thanks.
Oh, ned, you're alive! Peter, are you okay?
Where's the glowy thing? The glowy thing?
Don't worry, it's safe. It's in my backpack.
Ned, listen! The glowy thing is dangerous!
You missed the decathlon. I covered for you.
Ned, listen to me! We're at the Washington mon...
Peter, is that you? Hey, Liz.
Is that Liz? Put ned on the phone.
Tell her how you feel. You flake!
You are so lucky we won.
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?
I have to talk to ned. It's important!
Miss, all items on the belt, please.
There's something in ned's backpack!
It's dangerous. Don't let it go through an X-ray.
Liz? Liz! Damn it.
Mr. Harrison, can I be the one to tell Peter he's expelled?
The Washington monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.
Did you hear that?
No, no, no. Karen, what's going on up there?
The chitauri core has detonated
and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.
Oh, no. My friends are up there.
What? Don't worry, ma'am, everything's gonna be okay.
Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that's tall.
Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.
Just stay calm, everyone.
Oh, we are all going to die here.
Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.
We're freakin' screwed.
Okay, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.
The safety systems are completely failing.
We're very safe in here.
The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.
I'm going as fast as I can!
Let's go. Give me your hand.
You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.
What? Why? Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.
How do I get in there?
Activating reconnaissance drone.
Whoa. Has that been there this whole time? That's awesome.
Locating optimal entry point.
Proceed to southwest window.
Karen, I'm on my way.
There's a lot of glass here. You got this.
Keep coming, keep coming.
Ah!
Okay. Oh, my god.
Okay.
What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window.
Why are you hesitating? It's fine.
I've just never been this high before.
You have also not reinstalled your parachute,
so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.
Perfect.
Oh, my god.
Why is it not breaking?
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.
This is D.C. Metro police.
Identify yourself. My friends are in there! Stop!
Return to the ground immediately.
Okay, who's next? Me, it's my turn!
- Flash, seriously? - What are you doing?
Come on. Don't worry about the trophy.
Ahh!
Stand down!
Return to the ground immediately!
Return to the ground or we will open fire!
Go up, go up.
I got this.
Take my trophy!
This is your last chance!
Oh, I'm gonna die.
Look out!
Ahh!
I did it! Whoa!
Ahem. Hey, how you doing?
Don't worry about it. I got you.
Yes! Yes! Hey, hey, hey.
Big guy, quit moving around. I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.
Let's go, let's go!
Okay, okay.
Mr. harrington, go. Ned, come on.
This is your stop. Come on, Liz.
Go, go, go. Everybody out!
Move it, people. Move it, move it!
- Are you sure it's safe? - Liz!
You're okay. You're okay.
Okay.
Oh, my god. Good, good.
Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back.
Come on in. You guys good?
So is everyone okay?
This is your chance, Peter.
Kiss her.
Oh!
Thank you.
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?
I can finish the next order,
but without any new materials from that truck...
Yeah, damn it.
We still have enough to do the gargan deal though, right?
Yeah, but then that's it.
Oh, maybe it is time that i built the high-altitude seal.
Would you shut up about that? It's only one job.
No.
Eight years, not a word from the feds,
nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos
up there in stark tower.
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up
and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built.
Really?
I'm gonna kill him.
I'm gonna find him... I found him.
Spider-man swooped in, heroically saving
an academic decathlon team from queens.
The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.
Mom. Okay. All right.
Peter? Come here, come here.
Oh, my god.
This past weekend, midtown's academic decathlon team
defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.
Later that day, they also defeated death.
Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. All scream.
There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere.
It was tight, like a bon jovi concert.
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.
I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip.
Not again.
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured,
thanks to the spider-man.
Thank you, spider-man. Thank you, spider-man.
Up next: The spider-man mania is sweeping the school.
How can you show your spider spirit?
Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude.
What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?
Crazy, dude. It's crazy.
Should we tell everyone? No.
Should I tell everyone?
No, dude. That's not a good idea.
Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.
I'm not going to class. You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon. Dude, listen, I figured it out.
The wingsuit guy is stealing from damage control.
What he takes from damage control,
that's how he builds the weapons.
So all I gotta do is catch him.
But we have a Spanish quiz.
Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here.
Mr. stark is moving the avengers upstate
so when I bring this guy in... Dude.
You want to be a high school dropout?
I am so far beyond high school right now.
Parker, my office.
So...
You got detention.
You screwed up. You know what you did was wrong.
The question is, how are you gonna make things right?
Maybe you were trying to be cool.
But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years,
the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.
We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong.
Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something
you know is wrong... Where you going? Get back here.
Just think to yourself, what would captain America do?
Why are you here? You don't even have detention.
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.
Heh. It's you.
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.
May?
Hey, Karen. What's up?
- Hey, Peter. - How was your Spanish quiz?
I was wondering if you could help me.
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night,
but I can only remember part of a license plate.
I can run facial recognition
on the footage of that encounter.
Footage? Yes, Peter.
I record everything you see.
Everything? Like, all the time? Everything.
It's called the baby-monitor protocol.
Yeah, of course it is.
Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
With pleasure.
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.
What's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.
No, no, no. This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.
It is I, Thor, son of Odin!
No, no, no. That's definitely...
That's not what we wanted to watch.
Your impressions are very funny.
Fast-forward to the arms deal.
Okay.
The two on the right, who are they?
Searching law enforcement databases.
No records found for two of the individuals.
Nothing? One individual identified.
Aaron Davis, age 33.
He has a criminal record and an address here in queens.
Let's pay him a visit.
Would you like me to activate
the enhanced interrogation protocol?
Uh, yeah.
Remember me? Hey...
I need information. You'll give it to me now.
All right, chill. Come on!
What happened to your voice? What do you mean?
I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.
I'm not a girl! I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...
I'm not a girl! I'm a man.
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?
I need to know. Give me names or else.
You ain't ever done this before, huh?
Deactivate interrogation mode.
Look, man,
these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous.
They can't be out on the streets.
If one of them can cut delmar's bodega in half...
You know delmar's? Yeah, best sandwich in queens.
Sub haven's pretty good. It's too much bread.
I like bread. Come on, man, please.
Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.
The other night, you told that dude,
"if you shoot somebody, shoot me."
It's pretty ballsy.
I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood.
I got a nephew who live here.
Who are these guys?
What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?
Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing.
I don't know who he is or where he is.
I do know where he's gonna be. Really?
Yeah, this crazy dude i used to work with,
he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.
Yes! Heh. Yes.
Thank... Hey. Hey. Hey.
I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.
Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...
Yeah.
Where is it? Can I give you some advice?
Hm? You got to get better
at this part of the job. I don't understand.
I'm intimidating.
Staten island ferry, 11. Oh, that's soon.
Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.
No, no, no, no. Come fix this.
Two hours. You deserve that. I got ice cream in here.
You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. criminal.
Nice.
Okay, Karen, activate enhanced reconnaissance mode.
Sure thing.
He's up front, main deck.
I hate this guy.
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy? Just keep me posted.
There's no record of him in my criminal database.
Incoming call from may Parker.
Should I reroute to your heads-up display?
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.
- Who's the guy on the left? - Mac gargan.
Extensive criminal record, including homicide.
Would you like me to activate instant kill?
No, Karen, stop it with the instant kill already.
White pickup truck.
Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.
Oh, this is too perfect.
They got the weapons, buyers and sellers in one place.
Incoming call from Tony stark. No, no, no.
Don't answer. Mr. Parker. Got a sec?
- Uh, I'm actually at school. - No, you're not.
Nice work in D.C. okay.
My dad never really gave me a lot of support
and I'm trying to break the cycle of shame.
I'm kind of in the middle of something.
Don't cut me off when I'm complimenting you.
Anyway, great things are about to... what is that?
I'm at band practice.
That's odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago.
What's up? I gotta go!
End call. Hey.
I'll take those!
Yoink!
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry was at 10:30.
You missed it!
Whoo!
Spider guy's here.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.
Ah!
Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.
I got to say, the other guy was way better with that thing.
I'm honestly...
I'm... I'm shocked.
Freeze! FBI! Don't move!
Get on the ground! FBI!
What do you mean, FBI? The federal bureau of invest...
I know what "FBI" means. But what are they doing here?
What the...?
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Go, go, go, go!
Get out of there! Whoa!
Look out! Look out! Move! Move! Move!
- Move! - Get to the top deck.
We're getting out of here.
Ah! Ah!
Activate taser web!
You're messing with things you don't understand.
Oh, my god. What do I do?
Karen, give me an X-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.
Web grenade. Web grenade.
Splitter web, go.
- Great job, Peter. - You are 98 percent successful.
Ninety-eight? Yeah, spider-man!
No, no, no. No!
No!
Oh, my god!
No! Ah!
What the hell?
What the hell?
Hi, spider-man.
Band practice, was it?
Look! Look!
Yeah, iron man!
Uh, Mr. stark.
Hey, Mr. stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do? Whoa!
I think you've done enough.
- So that's it? - You're just gonna run?
Feds were waiting for us.
Now we're on iron man's radar?
Yeah, I'm running.
You should too.
You know i can't do that.
So now what?
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?
Seriously?
Yes. You will not regret this.
You in?
Previously on Peter screws the pooch,
I tell you to stay away from this.
Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit
so you could sneak around behind my back
doing the one thing I told you not to do.
Is everyone okay?
No thanks to you.
No thanks to me?
Those weapons were out there
and I tried to tell you about it,
but you didn't listen.
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?
Do you know I was the only one who believed in you?
Everyone else said I was crazy
to recruit a 14-year-old kid. I'm 15.
No. This is where you zip it, all right?
The adult is talking.
What if somebody had died tonight?
Different story, right? 'Cause that's on you.
And if you died,
I feel like that's on me.
I don't need that on my conscience.
Yes, sir, I'm sorry. Yes.
I understand. Sorry doesn't cut it.
I just wanted to be like you.
And I wanted you to be better.
Okay, it's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.
For how long? Forever.
Yeah, that's how it works. No, no. Please. Please.
Let's have it. You don't understand.
This is all I have. I'm nothing without this suit.
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it, okay?
God, I sound like my dad.
I don't have any other clothes.
Okay, we'll sort that out.
Hey.
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.
You can't do that.
Then this ferry thing happens.
I've called five police stations.
Five. I called five of your friends.
I called ned's mother. I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.
Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention.
I know you left the hotel room in Washington.
I know you sneak out of this house every night.
That's not fine.
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.
Just lay it out. It's just me and you.
I lost the stark internship.
What? Yeah.
What happened?
I just thought that i could work really hard
and he could... He would... you know.
But... I screwed it up.
Oh, it's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry i made you worry.
You know I'm not trying to ruin your life.
Yeah, I know.
Just...
I used to sneak out too. Yeah.
And take a shower. You smell.
You smell like... You smell like garbage.
I know.
Peter, you're a good kid and you're a smart kid,
so just try to keep your head straight, okay?
Okay.
All right, get out of here.
Are you expelled?
Do you have to go to that school on 46th
where their principal has a crossbow?
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.
You're so lucky.
Muy bueno, seсor Parker.
Hey.
Hey.
I thought you had calculus fifth period.
Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.
Hey, look, i...
I just wanted to apologize
about the whole decathlon thing.
It's fine.
Last week, decathlon was the most important thing,
but then i almost died.
No, I just... I'm...
I just mean that
it was not cool, especially...
Because...
I like you.
I know.
You do?
You're terrible at keeping secrets.
Yeah, you'd be surprised.
I got to get to class, but...
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention for...
Uh-huh. Ever, but...
I guess you already have a date to homecoming.
Actually, I was so busy planning it,
I never really got around to that part, so...
Uh, you want to
go with me?
Yeah. Sure.
Really? I mean, great. Cool.
Cool.
I'm actually going that way.
May, I need your help.
Right?
- It's game day. - So what's the plan?
Open the door for her. Mm-hm.
Tell her she looks nice, but not too much
because that's creepy. Don't be creepy.
No. And when I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips. I got this.
- Love you. - Bye.
You must be Peter.
Yeah.
I'm Liz's dad.
Put 'er there.
Hell of a grip.
Come on in here. Come on.
Hi, Peter.
You look very handsome.
Thank you.
You got his name right?
Freddie? Peter.
Peter. Peter.
I'm gonna go get Liz.
Okay.
You all right, Pete?
Yeah.
Because you look pale.
You want something to drink?
Like a bourbon
or a scotch, or something like that?
I'm not old enough to drink.
That's the right answer.
Wow! Wow, wow, wow,
do you look beautiful.
Please don't embarrass me, dad.
Doesn't she, Pete?
Yeah, you look really good.
Once again, that's the right answer.
Is that a corsage?
Thanks.
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe. All right.
Oh, right here. Perfect. Mom.
Okay. Come on, you guys.
Peter, closer.
Smile.
There you go.
Oh.
Sir, you don't have to drive us.
Nah, nah, it's not a big deal.
I'm going out of town. It's right on my way.
He's always coming and going.
Last time. Have fun.
Thank you. Promise.
He's cute. Shh.
See you in a couple of days.
Bye, baby. All right.
Come on, Pedro.
Bye, Peter. Have fun. Yeah, I will.
What are you gonna do, Pete?
What?
When you graduate, what do you think you'll do?
Oh, I don't know. Don't grill him, dad.
Just saying, you know.
All you guys who go to that school
you pretty much have your life planned out, right?
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.
Peter has an internship with Tony stark.
So I think he doesn't have to worry.
Really? Mm-hm.
- Stark? - So cool.
Oh. What do you do?
Actually, I don't intern for him anymore.
Seriously? Yeah, it got...
Boring.
It was boring?
You got to hang out with spider-man.
Really? Spider-man?
Wow. What's he like?
Yeah, he's nice.
Nice man. Solid dude.
Hm.
Look. So cute.
Oh.
I've seen you around, right?
I mean, somewhere.
We've... have we ever...? Because even the voice...
He does academic decathlon with me.
Oh. And he was at my party.
- Ah. - It was a great party.
Really great, yeah.
Beautiful house, a lot of windows.
You were there for, like, two seconds.
That was...
I was there longer than two seconds.
You disappeared. No.
No, I did not disappear. Yes, you did.
You disappeared like you always do.
Like you did in D.C. too.
That's terrible
what happened down there in D.C. though.
Were you scared?
I'll bet you were glad when your old pal spider-man
showed up in the elevator though, huh?
Yeah, well, I actually didn't go up.
I saw it all from the ground.
Yeah.
Very lucky that he was there that day.
Good old spider-man.
Dad, the light.
Here we are. End of the line.
Thanks, dad.
You head in there, gumdrop.
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.
Don't let him intimidate you.
Love you.
Love you, gumdrop. Have a safe flight.
Hi.
You guys look so pretty.
Does she know?
Know what?
So she doesn't. Good.
Close to the vest. I admire that.
I've got a few secrets of my own.
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...
Peter,
nothing is more important than family.
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.
So I'm gonna give you one chance.
Are you ready?
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened
and don't you ever,
ever
interfere with my business again.
'Cause if you do,
I'll kill you
and everybody you love.
I'll kill you dead.
That's what I'll do to protect my family, Pete.
Do you understand?
Hey.
I just saved your life. Now what do you say?
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Now, you go on in there,
you show my daughter a good time, okay?
Just not too good.
Hey.
What did he say to you?
I've got to go.
I'm... I'm sorry.
You don't deserve this.
Ah!
He gave you a choice.
You chose wrong. What the hell?
What's with the crappy costume?
My web-shooters.
Whoa!
I wasn't sure about this thing at first,
but... Damn.
Oh, gross.
Why did he send you here? Guess you'll never know.
Huh? Nice shot!
Yes!
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.
What? I know. I gotta tell Mr. stark.
Call happy hogan. He's Mr. stark's head of security.
Get a computer and track my phone for me.
Are you gonna be okay? Hurry, we gotta catch him
before he leaves town.
I'm sorry about dinner,
but I know when branzino's fresh,
and that was not fresh, okay?
So... ah!
Flash, I need your car and your phone.
Sir, technically, this is my dad's car, sir, so I can't...
Ah!
Hello, ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Go for ned.
Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.
Yeah, but where is it?
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the gamestop on Jackson Avenue.
Hey, where are the headlights on this thing?
I'm in flash's car. I'll pull the specs.
Okay, you're on speakerphone.
You stole flash's car? Awesome.
Yeah, it's awesome! It's awe...
Oh! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move! Move!
Peter, are you okay? I've never driven before.
Only with may in parking lots.
This is a huge step up. Whoa!
Hey, have you gotten through to happy yet?
Uh, yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.
Guy in the chair.
Takeoff in nine minutes.
Hello? Hello? Who is this?
Mr. happy, it's ned. Who?
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something important to tell you...
You gotta be shitting me. Damn.
Hey, ned, how we coming with those headlights?
Uh...
Round knob to the left of the steering wheel,
turn clockwise. Left, okay.
Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?
Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.
What? That makes no sense!
I thought he said he was going out of town!
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.
Sounded like he was catching a flight.
Something about taking off in nine minutes.
What? He was surrounded by boxes.
Boxes? It's moving day.
It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.
We just got to load Tony's old hulkbuster armor,
prototype for cap's new shield, and the meging...
The Meg... the... Thor's magic belt.
Okay, slow down. You're getting close.
It's on your right. What?
Turn right! Turn right!
Peter, are you okay? Yeah.
Just keep trying to get through to happy.
It's been an honor, spider-man.
What are you doing here? There's a dance.
Uh...
I'm looking
at porn.
Hey!
Surprised?
Oh, hey, Pete.
I didn't hear you come in.
It's over. I've got you.
You know, i gotta tell you, Pete,
I really, really admire your grit.
I see why Liz likes you.
I do. When you first came to the house,
I wasn't sure. I thought, "really?"
But I get it now.
How could you do this to her?
To her? I'm not doing anything to her, Pete.
I'm doing this for her.
Huh, yeah.
Peter,
you're young.
You don't understand how the world works.
Yeah, but I understand
that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.
How do you think your buddy stark paid for that tower?
Or any of his little toys?
Those people, Pete, those people up there,
the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want.
Guys like us, like you and me,
they don't care about us.
We build their roads and we fight all their wars
and everything, but they don't care about us.
We have to pick up after 'em.
We have to eat their table scraps.
That's how it is.
I know you know what I'm talking about, Peter.
Why are you telling me this?
Because I want you to understand.
And...
I needed a little time to get her airborne.
I'm sorry, Peter.
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.
True. Then again,
wasn't really trying to.
Chief, they're powering up engines.
Okay. Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on, come on.
Oh, god.
Okay, ready?
Hello!
Hello!
Please. Hey.
Hey, please. I'm down here.
I'm down here. I'm stuck.
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.
Come on, Peter.
Come on, spider-man.
Come on, spider-man.
Come on, spider-man.
Come on, spider-man!
Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.
Oh, yeah.
Retroreflective panels engaged.
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.
It's probably just drag on the new turbines.
Ah!
Whoa!
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.
This better work, Mason.
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life. Yeah.
Hey! Ah! Whew.
You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit
and override their security.
Cloning transponder signal.
Launching decoy drone.
Whoa.
Entering new coordinates.
Good, so it's on its way?
Yes, sir, right on course. Okay, thank you.
All right.
Hot dog.
Just a typical homecoming
on the outside of an invisible jet... ah!
Fighting my girlfriend's dad.
Oh! Oh! Ah!
Oh, god!
Whew. I can't believe that worked.
Chief, they're losing altitude. Get out of there.
I'm not going home empty-handed.
Oh, my god.
- Get out of there. - What are you doing?
Please turn! Please turn!
Hey, Pedro.
Bingo.
Your wingsuit.
Your wingsuit's gonna explode!
Time to go home, Pete.
I'm trying to save you!
No!
No.
No!
Ah! Ah!
It looked so insane. That whole...
Like, it was just crazy.
He was just, like...
And you were like, "ah!"
And then I just hit him with the "fffew."
It was so... Oh, my god.
You saved me.
It was awesome.
Hey, Liz.
I'm gonna miss you.
Bye.
Liz.
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?
The dance?
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.
Well, yeah, but i... I mean, your dad...
I can't imagine what you're going through.
If there's anything i can do to help...
I guess we're moving to Oregon.
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.
Anyways, dad doesn't want us here
during the trial, so...
Liz, i... i...
Bye, Peter.
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.
Congratulations, decathlon national champions.
Yeah!
I'm gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon,
but just for motivation right now at this practice.
I'm a little ahead of the game,
but we will need a new team captain next year.
So I am appointing Michelle.
Yeah!
Uh, thank you.
My... my friends call me mj.
I thought you didn't have any friends.
I didn't.
I gotta go. Hey, where you going?
What are you hiding, Peter?
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.
All right, so we should run some drills.
Yeah.
Hey, happy. What... What are you doing here?
I really owe you one.
I don't know what I would do without this job.
I mean, before I met Tony...
So how long you been here?
Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.
Is he here too?
In the toilet? No, he's upstate.
Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?
Yeah, let's go.
Take a look.
It's pretty impressive, huh?
They just finished remodeling the whole thing.
You don't see that every day. Oh, there they are.
How was the ride up? Good.
Give me a minute with the kid.
Seriously? Yeah.
I got to talk to the kid.
I'll be close behind.
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.
Sorry I took your suit.
I mean, you had it coming.
Actually, it turns out it was the perfect
tough-love moment that you needed, right?
To urge you on? Wouldn't you think?
Don't you think? I guess.
Let's just say it was.
Mr. stark, I really...
You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.
But then you did the right thing.
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies.
All right, not my best analogy.
I was wrong about you.
I think, with a little more mentoring,
you could be a real asset to the team.
To the... to the team? Yeah. Anyway,
there's about 50 reporters behind that door.
Real ones, not bloggers.
When you're ready,
why don't you try that on?
And I'll introduce the world
to the newest official member of the avengers:
Spider-man.
I... heh.
Yeah, give that a look.
So after the press conference,
happy will show you to your room, your new quarters.
Where's he between? He's next to vision?
Yeah, vision's not big on doors.
It's fun. Or walls.
You'll fit right in.
Thank you, Mr. stark,
but I'm... I'm good.
You're good? How are you good?
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.
Friendly neighborhood spider-man.
Somebody's got to look out for the little guy, right?
You're turning me down?
You better think about this. Look at that.
Look at me.
Last chance. Yes or no?
No. Okay.
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.
Ah, happy will take you home.
Yeah? Yeah.
Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.
Thank you, Mr. stark.
Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.
See you around. Okay.
That was a test, right?
There's nobody back there?
Yes, you passed.
All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
Thank you, Mr. stark. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
Told you he was a good kid.
Pepper! Pepper!
Where's the kid?
He left. Everybody's waiting.
He actually made a really mature choice.
It just surprised the heck out of us.
Did you guys screw this up?
He told the kid to wait in the car.
Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people waiting
for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?
Think of something. How about, um,
hap, you still got that ring?
Do i... i...
The engagement ring. Are you kidding?
I've been carrying this since 2008.
Okay.
I think I can think of something better than that.
Well, it would buy us a little time.
Like we need time.
I can't believe you have that thing in your pocket.
Let me to get the door for you, hon?
I got it.
Aunt may, did you do dinner already?
May?
What the f...?!
Look who it is.
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?
Relax.
This? It's not on you.
It's on our little spider friend.
I've got some boys on the outside
who would love to meet him.
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.
And I heard a rumor...
You know who he is.
If I knew who he was,
he'd already be dead.
Toomes, your family's here!
Hi, I'm captain America, here to talk to you
about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.
Patience.
Sometimes Patience is the key to victory.
Sometimes it leads to very little
and it seems like it's not worth it.
And you wonder
why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.
How many more of these?

Is it ready?

It's a possible gamma sickness. Milwaukee.

Have our people look for a white man at the bottling plant.
Tell them no contact! If he even sees them, he's gone!
I got you who I could. Short notice, but they're all quality.
And I pulled you one ace.
Emil Blonsky. Born in Russia, raised in England.
And on loan to SOCOM from the Royal Marines.
GENERAL: I know you cashed in some chips for this, Joe.
Glad I could help. Just make it good.
SPARR: This is the target and the location. Snatch and grab, live capture.
You'll have your dart clips and suppression ordnance,
but live fire is for backup only.
We got local out there, but we want it tight and quiet.
Is he a fighter?
Your target is a fugitive from the US government
who stole military secrets.
He is also implicated in the deaths of two scientists,
a military officer, an Idaho state trooper and possibly two Canadian hunters.
So don't wait to see if he's a fighter!
Tranq him and bring him back.

I knew something was different before I got the shot off.
He had it on him when he bolted.
Is that a girlfriend? She helps him, maybe?
She is no longer a factor.
We closed that door to him a long time ago. He's alone.
He wants to be alone. But see if he's been talking to anybody.
Forgive me, sir?
Doesn't anybody want to talk about what went down in there? 'Cause...
He didn't lose us.
And he was not alone, sir. We had him.
And then something hit us, something...
Something big hit us!
It threw a forklift truck like it was a softball!
It was the most powerful thing I've ever seen.
Well, it's gone.
Well, if Banner knows what it is,
I'm gonna track him down, I'm gonna put my foot on his throat
- and I'm gonna... - That was Banner.
It
was Banner.
- You have to explain that statement, sir. - No, I don't.
You've done a good job.
Pack up and get our men on a plane. We're going home.
Wait.
Please.
(IN ENGLISH) Where am I?
BLONSKY: I've run into bad situations on crap missions before.
I've seen good men go down
purely because someone didn't let us know what we were walking into.
I've moved on to the next one, because that's what we do, right?
I mean, that's the job.
But this?
This is a whole new level of weird.
And I don't feel inclined to step away from it.
So if you're taking another crack at him, I want in.
And, with respect, you should be looking for a team that's prepped and ready to fight,
because if that thing shows up again,
you're gonna have a lot of professional tough guys pissing in their pants.
Sir.

(CHATTERING IN SPANISH)
Tienes m Аs stretchy?
Yeah. Perfecto.
(MOTORCYCLE PASSING)
Let me emphasise that what I'm about to share with you
is tremendously sensitive, both to me personally and the Army.
You're aware that we've got an Infantry Weapons Development programme.
Well, in WWll, they initiated a subprogram
for Bio-Tech Force Enhancement.
Yeah, Super Soldier.
Yes.
An oversimplification, but yes.
And I dusted it off, got 'em doing serious work again, bold work.
Across the hall, they were trying to arm you better.
We were tryin' to make you better.
Banner's work was very early phase. It wasn't even weapons application.
He thought he was working on radiation resistance.
I would never have told him what the project really was.
But he was so sure of what he was onto, that he tested it on himself.
And something went very wrong.
Or it went very right.
As far as I'm concerned, that man's whole body is the property of the US Army.
You said he wasn't working on weapons, right?
- No. - But you were. You were, weren't you?
You were trying other things.
One serum we developed
was very promising.
- So why did he run? - He's a scientist.
He is not one of us.
- Blonsky, how old are you? 45? - 39.
- It takes a toll, doesn't it? - Yes, it does.
So get out of the trenches.
You should be a Colonel by now, with your record.
No, I'm a fighter. I'll be one for as long as I can.
You know, if I could take what I know now, put it in the body I had ten years ago,
that would be someone I wouldn't want to fight.
I could probably arrange something like that.
Take care, kids.
Stan, I give you my word,
whatever you've heard about me, it's not true.
Oh, I know it. I always knew it.
I mean, you know how I felt about you two.
- Have you talked to her? - No.
She doesn't know that I'm here.
- She's with somebody? - Yeah, he's a head shrink.
They say he's one of the best. But a really nice guy.
Good. That's good.
- Bruce, what can I do to help you? - I could use a bed for a few nights.
- You can have the spare room upstairs. - That'd be so great.
There is one other thing.
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Coming through.
Hey, pal. I got a delivery on five.
I don't think there's anybody up there.
Oh, man. I'm gonna catch hell if I don't collect. You got to let me try.
I'll tell you what. I got an extra medium. Take it on the house.
- You are the man. - God bless you, brother.
All right.
(COMPUTERS BLEEPING)
Okay.
We're pretty well closed here, folks. I'm sorry.
Oh, come on, Stan. It's Friday night.
Oh, kids.
I got nothing but marinara now.
Oh, I got to have a Mister Pink, please.
She worked through dinner again, of course.
Stan?
And he... I go, "So, yeah, I mean, where were you?
"I can't... I don't know where you were, Cecil."
And he goes, "Not where you been at."
I thought, "Oh, my God." I just felt so awful.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Bruce?
Betty? What's going on?
Betty...
Just tell me if I saw what I think I saw.
- I don't know what to say. - Please, just tell me the truth.
BETTY: Don't go. Don't go.
I want you to come with me now.
Please. Come with me.
Please.
BETTY: It's our data.
I got in there before they carted it all away.
I hoped somewhere that it might tell us something someday.
- Does the General know that you have this? - No, I don't think so.
I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years.
You have to be sure.
Bruce, I don't understand why we can't just go in there together and talk to him.
He told me what he wanted to do. He wants it out of me.
He wants to dissect it so that he can replicate it.
He wants to make it a weapon.
- Hi. - Hi.
- I thought you might want to... - Thanks.
Listen, I should leave early, as early as I can.
Really? You can't stay at all?
I want to, but it's just not safe for me to be here.
- Lf I could borrow some cash... - Of course.
I need to take a bus.
Well, at least let me walk you to the station.
Okay.
- You have everything you need? - Yeah.
I...
What?
- Good night. - Good night.
I hope you get some rest.
We're giving you a very low dose only.
I need you sharp out there and disciplined.
First sign of any side effect,
we stop and you're off team until you straighten out.
- Agreed? - Agreed.
You'll get two separate infusions.
One into the deep muscle, one into the bone marrow centres.
The bone ones are going to hurt.
(GRUNTS)
Is everything okay?
I think so.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Come here.
- I just wanna do this. - Oh.
- It's better like that. - Yeah?
It feels too tight, huh?
- Yeah, a little. - Okay.
- What? - They're here.
- Betty, look at me, look at me! - Bruce!
You have to go far away from me as you can!
- Don't argue with me, just go. Go! - Bruce!
(CAR ALARM SOUNDING)
Damn it! We'd have had snipers on target in three more minutes.
I wanna know who jumped the gun.

I got him!
Stop! Stop!

- Dad, please don't do this. - You can't see this clearly. Now, get inside.

You did the right thing, calling us.
I need to know where they're going.
She'll be in incredible danger as long as she's with him.
From who?
He protected her. You almost killed her.
I give you my word, her safety is my main concern at this point.
You know, it's a point of professional pride with me
that I can always tell when somebody's lying.
And you are.
I don't know where he's going.
- I know she'll help him, if she can. - Then she's aiding a fugitive.
And I can't help either one of them.
I used to wonder why she never talked about you.
Now I know!
GENERAL: Where does she meet these guys?

I will say this for him. He's got a heart like a machine.

Okay.

Well, you know, the circumstances called for a little improvisation.
Wow.
Okay, so they didn't have a great selection, but I got you some options.
First thing's first.
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?
- No. - They were the stretchiest pair they had.
I'll take my chances.
FEMALE REPORTER: Rumours continue to swirl about a violent clash
between forces of the US military and an unknown adversary
on the campus of Culver University earlier today.
Sophomores Jack McGhee and Jim Wilson witnessed some of the battle.
JIM: It was so big.
- It was like this huge, like, hulk! - Yeah.
FEMALE REPORTER: McGhee, who happens to be a reporter for the campus paper,
captured this on his cell phone.
Further search for the mysterious "hulk"
was postponed by powerful thunderstorms in the Smoky Mountain National Forest.

- Good to see you back on your feet, soldier. - Thank you, sir.
How do you feel?
Pissed off and ready for round three.
Basically, we can't use any of this, because they can track all of it.
Well, my lip gloss? Can they track that?
- No. You can take your lip gloss. - Thank you.
- Well, I need my glasses. - Well, you can take
- your glasses and your watch, okay? - Okay.
We can use most of it. We just can't use the credit cards, the ID or the phone.
- Don't even turn that on. - Okay.
And we'll take the cash, obviously.
How will we get where we need to go on $40 and no credit cards?
Well, we could sell this.
No. No, that's the only thing you have left from her. No.
Well, we'll have to try and get it back.
SPARR: Federal is already monitoring phones,
plastic and Dr Ross's web accounts,
and local PD have been placed on alert.
They'll pop up somewhere and when they do, it comes straight to us.
GENERAL: They're not gonna just pop up.
He made it five years and got across borders without making any mistakes.
He's not gonna use a damn credit card now.
If he was trying to escape, he'd be long gone.
He's not trying to escape this time.
He's looking for help and that's how we're gonna get him.
We know what they're after and we know he's been talking to somebody.
You all have copies of the correspondence.
The aliases Mr Green and Mr Blue
have been added to the SHIELD Operations Database.
If he comes up for air, we'll be waiting.
If he makes a peep, we'll hear him.
And when he slips up, we'll be ready.
Hey.
Smile.
What is it like?
When it happens, what do you experience?
Remember those experiments we volunteered for at Harvard?
Those induced hallucinations?
It's a lot like that, just a thousand times amplified.
It's like someone's poured a litre of acid into my brain.
- Do you remember anything? - Just fragments. Images.
There's too much noise. I can never derive anything out of it.
- But then it's still you inside it. - No. No, it's not.
I don't know. In the cave, I really felt like it knew me.
Maybe your mind is in there,
it's just overcharged and can't process what's happening.
I don't want to control it. I want to get rid of it.
Are you ready?
Let's even the playing field a little.
Gentlemen.
(HORN BLARING)
BETTY: Bruce, wake up. There's something going on.
We got to go. Walk toward the back. Just don't move too fast.
All right. Come.
BETTY: It is a long way uptown. I think the subway's probably quickest.
Me in a metal tube, deep underground,
with hundreds of people in the most aggressive city in the world?
Right. Let's get a cab.
CAB DRIVER: Come on, now! Let's go! You're too slow! You drive like a woman!
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)
- Very nice. You see her? - Oh, my.
Very pretty. Watch out, you goat!
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Are you out of your mind?
- What is wrong with you? - What's the matter, baby?
You don't like a good ride?
(GRUNTING)
Asshole!
(BETTY GRUNTS)
You know, I know a few techniques could help you
- manage that anger very effectively. - You zip it. We're walking.
Okay.
Excuse me. Dr Sterns?
- Yes. - I'm sorry to bother you. I'm Elizabeth Ross.
Oh! Dr Ross!
- I have someone who'd like to meet you. - Okay.
It's Mr Blue, isn't it?
Mr Green?
I got to tell you, I've been wondering if you were even real.
And if you were, what would it look like?
A person with that much power lurking in him.
Nothing could have surprised me more
than this unassuming man shaking my hand.
But, look. We're not strolling into the park for a picnic, here.
Even if everything goes perfectly,
if we induce an episode, if we get the dosage exactly right,
is that going to be a lasting cure
or just some antidote to suppress that specific flare-up?
I don't know.
What I'm saying is that if we overshoot this by even the smallest integer
we're dealing with concentrations with extraordinary levels of toxicity.
- You mean it could kill him. - Kill him? Yeah. I should say so.
You should know that there's a flip side to this, too.
If we miss on the low side, if we induce me and it fails,
this will be very dangerous for you.
Look. I've always been more curious than cautious,
and that's served me pretty well. So, are we going to do this?
How you feeling, man?
Like a monster.
Okay. On the table.
These will protect you from yourself if you have a strong reaction.
You can tell me later if you thought it was strong.
Oh, come on! Stupid graduate students.
Okay...
You, you, you.
This will be a somewhat novel sensation.
(MACHINE STARTING UP)
We have begun.
The dialysis machine will mix the antidote with your blood.
Except the antidote will only take hold once we've achieved a full reaction.
Just relax.
Okay. We are comprehensive.
Here you go.
All right. We set to pop?
I'd take your hands off him.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, my God!
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
Wait, wait! There's more! Wait!
- Now. Okay, now! - STERNS: Wait.
Now, do it! Do it!
Bruce! Bruce, look at me.
Stay with me. The antidote, now! Sterns, do it now!
Bruce, look at me. Look in my eyes. Please, look in my eyes.
(MACHINE BEEPING)
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!
(HULK GROANING)
Bruce.
Oh, my God.
Bruce? Bruce, can you hear me?
Bruce?
(GASPS)
It's okay. You're okay. You're okay.
You did it.
He's fine. This is fantastic.
BETTY: It's over.
Hi.
Hi.
That was the most extraordinary thing I have seen in my entire life!
Okay, you know what? Stop, please.
We need to go back and talk about what just happened in there.
Absolutely. Okay. The gamma pulse came from the amygdala.
- I think Dr Ross's primer... - Are you okay?
...lets the cells absorb the energy temporarily, and then it abates.
That's why you didn't die of radiation sickness years ago!
Now, maybe we've neutralised those cells permanently,
or maybe we just suppressed that event.
I'm inclined to think the latter, but it's hard to know
because none of our test subjects ever survived.
- Of course, they weren't getting the primer! - Wait, wait.
- Wait, what did you just say? - They weren't getting
- the myostatin primer... - No, no, no. Test subjects?
What test subjects?
Come with me.
- SPARR: What's the activity level? - Snipers are covering Alpha sector.
STERNS ON RADIO: We started on rats and mice,
but it just completely fried them, so we had to go bigger.
And we still don't know which is more toxic, the gamma or your blood.
- What do you mean, my blood? - Bruce, this is all you.
You didn't send me much to work with, so I had to concentrate it and make more.
With a little more trial and error, there's no end to what we can do!
This is potentially Olympian!
This gamma technology has limitless applications.
We'll unlock hundreds of cures.
We will make humans impervious to disease!
No, no, we've got to destroy it.
- Wait, what? - All of it.
Tonight. We're gonna incinerate it.
- Is this the whole supply? - What...
We could get the Nobel for this!
You don't understand the power of this thing.
It is too dangerous. It cannot be controlled.
At your discretion, shooter.
STERNS ON RADIO: Three of us! This is Promethean fire!
BRUCE ON RADIO: It's just...
SOLDIER ON RADIO: No shot.
Blonsky's going in.
GENERAL: Blonsky, stand down. My daughter's in there!
We have the antidote now.
They don't want the antidote! They want to make it a weapon!
(SIRENS WAILING)
And if we let it go, we will never get it back.
You don't know how powerful this thing is.
I hate the government just as much as anyone,
but you're being a little paranoid, don't you think?
(GASPS)
Bruce! Bruce!
Get out.
(BETTY SCREAMS)
Where is it? Come on, where is it?
(BRUCE EXCLAIMS)
(WATCH BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Show him to me.
Blonsky!
(HEART BEATING SLOWLY)
SOLDIER: Miss!
Take this.
If you took it from me, I'm gonna put you in a hole for the rest of your life.
Betty.
I will never forgive what you've done to him.
He's a fugitive.
You made him a fugitive
to cover your failures and to protect your career.
Don't ever speak to me as your daughter again.
It's only because you're my daughter that you're not in handcuffs, too.
SPARR: Are you telling me you can make more like him?
No! Not yet. I sorted out a few pieces, but it's not like I can put together
the same Humpty Dumpty, if that's what you're asking.
He was a freak accident! The goal is to do it better!
So Banner's the only...
- She's an annoying bitch. - Why are you always hitting people?
Now what possibly could I have done to deserve such aggression?
It's not what you've done. It's what you're gonna do.
I want what you got out of Banner. I want that.
You look like you've got a little something in you already, don't you?
I want more. You've seen what he becomes, right?
I have.
And it's beautiful.
Godlike.
Well, I want that.
I need that. Make me that.
I don't know what you've got inside you already.
The mix could be
an abomination.
(GASPING) I didn't say I was unwilling.
I just need informed consent.
And you've given it.
This is what I was trying to explain.
I don't know what you've been ladling into yourself.
But clearly it worked.
Let's assume you don't understand a word I'm saying,
but if you'll just get back on the table,
I can fix this.
(ABOMINATION GROWLING)
(ABOMINATION LAUGHING)
SOLDIER 1: Shoot it! SOLDIER 2: Hey!
No!
(SOLDIERS SCREAMING)
SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader.
They took out two of our guys, two of our guys!
Blonsky and the Major are still inside!
(ABOMINATION GROWLING)
Come on! Move, move, move, move!
It's over there!
SOLDIER 2: Drop them!
SOLDIER 3: What is that thing? SOLDIER 4: Shoot it!
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
Okay. All right! You... You, drive! Let's go! Move, move!
SOLDIER 5: Delta 4 to Leader! SOLDIER 6: Go, go, go, go, go!
SOLDIER 5: Something big just went off down here!
General, you should hear this!
The Hulk is in the street! I repeat, the Hulk is in the street!
That's impossible. You get a hold of yourself, young man.
You get it together. What is your position?
121st Street, heading north on Broadway!
Turn us around.
We're going back. Why are we going back?
Damn it! Give me eyes down there!
Yes, sir!
What the hell was that?
Go, go, go!
(SIRENS WAILING)
No!
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
(GROWLING)
One of yours?
Oh, my God. What have you done?
OFFICER: Fire at him, fire at him!
Do you think a rifle's gonna hurt that?
Come on!
Sweet.
(ABOMINATION ROARING)
Booyah!
(LAUGHING)
(CAR ALARMS BEEPING)
Get out of there, soldier!
Stacy!
Give me a real fight!
Sir?
Sir?
Tell them to bring everything they've got and head for Harlem.
It has to be me. You have to take me back there.
What are you saying?
You think you can control it?
No, no, not control it, but, I don't know, maybe aim it.
And what if you can't?
We made this thing.
All of us.
Please.
- Land us near it. - No, no. No, keep us high.
Open the back door.
Bruce! Bruce, stop! Stop! What are you doing?
Think about this! You don't even know if you'll change!
You don't have to do this! Please, this is insane!
Betty, I've got to try.
I'm sorry.
Oh, shit!
- Get her in here! - Come on, miss.
(HULK GROWLING)
There. Betty!
(PEOPLE CLAMOURING)
(ROARING)
Hulk!
Yeah!
(BOTH GROWLING)
(ABOMINATION LAUGHING)
Come on!
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING ON POLICE RADIO)
(ROARING)
Is that all you've got?
Use that thing, soldier! Give him some help!
Which one?
Help the green one, damn it! Which one do you think?
Cut the other one in half!
Ross!
Keep it on him!
(HULK AND ABOMINATION GRUNTING)
PILOT: Look, I got to put it down! GENERAL: Hang on!
(ALARM SOUNDING)
(ABOMINATION AND HULK GRUNTING)
Dad?
(GROANING)
Are you hurt? Let me help you.
I'm all right. Just find a way out.
(GROWLING)
(CHUCKLING)
You don't deserve this power! Now watch her die!
(BOTH GRUNTING)
Look out!
General?
Any last words?
Hulk smash!

It's okay.
Betty.

(SEAGULLS SQUAWKING)
(HEART BEATING)
(HEART BEATING RAPIDLY)
GENERAL: Reload.
Reload.
TONY: The smell of stale beer and defeat.
You know, I hate to say, "I told you so," General,
but that Super Soldier programme was put on ice for a reason.
I've always felt hardware was more reliable.
- Stark. - General.
You always wear such nice suits.
Touche.
- I hear you have an unusual problem. - You should talk.
You should listen.
What if I told you we were putting a team together?
Who's "we"?

Now, I know what you're thinking.
"Oh, no! Thor's in a cage. How did this happen?"
Well, sometimes you have to get captured
just to get a straight answer out of somebody.
It's a long story, but basically, I'm a bit of a hero.
See, I spent some time on Earth...
Fought some robots, saved the planet a couple of times.
Then I went searching through the cosmos
for some magic, colorful Infinity Stone things.
Didn't find any.
That's when I came across a path of death and destruction,
which led me all the way here into this cage,
where I met you.
How much longer do you think we'll be here?
Thor, son of Odin.
Surtur, son of a bitch.
You're still alive.
I thought my father killed you a half a million years ago.
I cannot die.
Not until I fulfill my destiny
and lay waste to your home.
It's funny you should mention that.
Because I've been having these terrible dreams of late.
Asgard up in flames, falling to ruins.
And you, Surtur, are at the center of all of them.
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the fall of Asgard.
- The great prophecy... - Hang on.
Hang on.
I'll be back around shortly.
I really feel like we were connecting there.
Okay, so Ragnarok. Tell me about that. Walk me through it.
My time has come.
When my crown is reunited with the Eternal Flame,
I shall be restored to my full might.
I will tower over the mountains,
and bury my sword deep in Asgard's...
Hang on. Give it a second.
I swear, I'm not even moving. It's just doing this on its own.
I'm really sorry.
Okay, so let me get this straight.
You're going to put your crown into the Eternal Flame
and then you'll suddenly grow as big as a house?
A mountain!
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard?
Odin is not on Asgard.
And your absence has left the throne defenseless.
Okay, so where is it? This crown?
This is my crown, the source of my power.
Oh, that's a crown. I thought it was a big eyebrow.
It's a crown.
Anyway, it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok
is rip that thing off your head.
But Ragnarok has already begun.
You cannot stop it.
I am Asgard's doom, and so are you.
All will suffer, all will burn.
That's intense.
To be honest, seeing you grow really big
and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle.
But it looks like I'm gonna have to choose option B,
where I bust out of these chains,
knock that tiara off your head, and stash it away in Asgard's vault.
You cannot stop Ragnarok.
Why fight it?
Because that's what heroes do.
Wait, I'm sorry. I didn't time that right.
And, now!
You have made a grave mistake, Odinson.
I make grave mistakes all the time.
Everything seems to work out.
Heimdall, I know it's been a while, but I could really use a fast exit.
Heimdall?
Heimdall was an idiot.
This job should have made him rich.
Now, the job ain't easy
but it does have its benefits.
The Bifrost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms has to offer.
I mean, it's all mine for the taking.
Behold...
My stuff.
I'm particularly fond of these.
I pulled them out of a place on Midgard called Texas.
I even named them. Des and Troy.
You see, when you put them together,
they destroy.
Heimdall, come on.
Stay!
Heimdall? I'm running short on options.
Heimdall?
Skurge?
Is that important?
You girls are in for a treat.
Girls!
Well, well, well. Look who decided to pop in.
Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains.
Who are you?
Don't you remember? I'm Skurge. We fought together on Vanaheim.
Right. Where is Heimdall?
That traitor. No one knows. He's a fugitive of the throne.
Traitor?
Yeah. You see, Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty
but he disappeared before the trial.
Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the universe.
Sure.
Hold on. I'm supposed to announce your arrival.
What the hell is that?
Oh, brother. This is it.
I take my leave.
You fool, you didn't listen!
I'm sorry.
Lady Sif, get help!
Somebody, help!
Sorry for all I've done.
It's all right. Hold on.
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.
They'd be lucky to have you.
I'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract.
- I just couldn't help myself. - I know.
I'm a trickster.
So mischievous.
Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog.
It was a wonderful joke.
'Twas indeed hilarious.
You are the savior of Asgard.
- Tell my story. - I will.
Build a statue for me.
We will build a big statue for you.
With my helmet on, with the big bendy horns.
I will tell Father what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
And so, Loki died of his wounds,
giving his life for ours.
He fought back those disgusting elves,
he brought peace to the realm.
Loki, my boy...
'Twas many moons ago I found you on that frostbitten battlefield.
On that day, I did not yet see in you
Asgard's savior. No.
You were merely a little blue baby icicle
that melted this old fool's heart.
Bravo! Bravo! Well done. Bravo.
Father.
Shit.
My son, Thor, has returned!
Greetings, my boy.
It's an interesting play. What's it called?
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The people wanted to commemorate him.
Indeed they should.
I like the statue.
A lot better looking than he was when he was alive, though.
A little less weaselly, less greasy, maybe.
Do you know what this is?
The skull of Surtur. That's a formidable weapon!
Do me a favor. Lock this away in a vault
so it doesn't turn into a giant monster and destroy the whole planet.
Thank you, dear.
So it's back to Midgard for you, is it?
Nope.
I've been having this reoccurring dream lately.
Every night, I see Asgard fall into ruins.
That's just a silly dream,
signs of an overactive imagination.
Possibly.
But then I decide to go out there and investigate.
And what do I find, but the Nine Realms completely in chaos.
Enemies of Asgard assembling, plotting our demise,
all while you, Odin, the protector of those Nine Realms,
are sitting here in your bathrobe, eating grapes.
Yes, it is best to respect our neighbors' freedom.
Yes, of course, the freedom to be massacred.
Yes, besides I've been rather busy myself.
Watching theater.
Board meetings, and security council meetings...
- You're really gonna make me do it? - Do what?
You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.
Not even your face.
You've gone quite mad. You'll be executed for this.
Then I'll see you on the other side, brother.
All right, I yield.
Behold!
Thor...
- Odinson. - No.
You had one job. Just the one.
Where's Odin?
You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you.
Asgard was prospering. You've ruined everything.
- Ask them. - Where's Father? Did you kill him?
You had what you wanted. You had the independence you asked for.
Okay. I know exactly where he is.
I swear I left him right here.
Right here on the sidewalk, or right there where the building is being demolished?
Great planning.
How was I supposed to know?
Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.
No? Then why do you dress like one?
- Hey. - I can't believe you're alive.
I saw you die. I mourned you, I cried for you.
I'm honored.
Ask him.
Hi. Would you mind taking a picture with us?
Sure.
Start figuring out where he is.
Oh, my God.
Sorry to hear that Jane dumped you.
She didn't dump me, you know.
I dumped her. It was a mutual dumping.
What's this? What are you doing?
This isn't me.
Loki.
Thor Odinson.
God of Thunder.
You can put down the umbrella.
So, Earth has wizards now?
The preferred term is "Master of the Mystic Arts."
You can leave that now.
All right, wizard. Who are you? Why should I care?
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange, and I have some questions for you.
Take a seat.
Tea?
I don't drink tea.
What do you drink?
Not tea.
So, I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from other realms
that may be a threat to this world.
Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.
He's a worthy inclusion.
Then why bring him here?
We're looking for my father.
So, if I were to tell you where Odin was,
all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard?
Promptly.
Great! Then I'll help you.
If you knew where he was, why didn't you call me?
I have to tell you, he was adamant that he not be disturbed.
Your father said he had chosen to remain in exile.
And you don't have a phone.
No, I don't have a phone,
but you could have sent an electronic letter. It's called an email.
- Yeah, do you have a computer? - No. What for?
Anyway, my father is no longer in exile.
So if you could tell me where he is, I can take him home.
Gladly. He's in Norway.
I'm just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications.
Nope.
We don't need that.
Will you stop doing that?
I need just one strand of your hair.
Let me explain something. My hair is not to be meddled with.
We could have just walked.
He's waiting for you.
All right.
Don't forget your umbrella.
Yes.
Sorry.
There we go.
I suppose I'll need my brother back.
Yeah. Right.
I have been falling for 30 minutes!
You can handle him from here.
Yes. Of course. Thank you very much for your help.
Good luck.
Handle me? Who are you?
Loki.
You think you're some kind of sorcerer?
Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...
Bye-bye.
Father?
Look at this place. It's beautiful.
Father, it's us.
My sons.
I've been waiting for you.
I know. We've come to take you home.
Home, yes.
Your mother, she calls me.
Do you hear it?
Loki, lift your magic.
Took me quite a while to break free from your spell.
Frigga would have been proud.
Come and sit with me. I don't have much time.
I know we failed you.
But we can make this right.
I failed you.
It is upon us. Ragnarok.
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. I put an end to Surtur.
No.
It has already begun. She's coming.
My life was all that held her back. But my time has come.
I cannot keep her away any longer.
Father, who are you talking about?
Goddess of Death. Hela.
My firstborn.
Your sister.
Your what?
Her violent appetites grew beyond my control.
I couldn't stop her, so I imprisoned her. Locked her away.
She draws her strength from Asgard,
and once she gets there, her powers will be limitless.
Whatever she is, we can stop her together. We can face her together.
No, we won't.
I'm on a different path now.
This you must face alone.
I love you, my sons.
Look at that.
Remember this place.
Home.
Brother.
This was your doing.
So he's gone.
That's a shame. I would've liked to have seen that.
You must be Hela.
I'm Thor, son of Odin.
Really? You don't look like him.
Perhaps we can come to an arrangement.
You sound like him.
Kneel.
Beg your pardon?
Kneel.
Before your queen.
I don't think so.
It's not possible.
Darling, you have no idea what's possible.
Bring us back!
No!
Loki!
Who are you? What have you done with Thor?
I'm Hela.
I'm just a janitor.
You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts.
How would you like a job?
Are you a fighter?
Or are you food?
I'm just passing through.
It is food.
On your knees.
He's mine.
Wait!
Wait!
He's mine.
So if you want him, you go through me.
But we've already got him.
All right, then. I guess I go through you.
More food.
Thank you.
Scrapper 142. I need clearance and an audience with the boss.
I've got something special.
Hey! Where are you taking me?
Answer me!
Hey!
I am Thor, son of Odin. I need to get back to Asgard.
Many apologies, your majesty.
It's come to my attention that you don't know who I am.
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn,
the commander of the Legions of Asgard,
the rightful heir to the throne, and the Goddess of Death.
My father is dead.
As are the princes. You're welcome.
We were once the seat of absolute power in the cosmos.
Our supremacy was unchallenged.
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.
Our destiny is to rule over all others.
And I am here to restore that power.
Kneel before me
and rise into the ranks of my great conquest.
Whoever you are,
whatever you've done, surrender now!
Or we will show you no mercy.
Whoever I am? Did you listen to a word I said?
This is your last warning!
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Fine.
Charge!
I've missed this.
Still, it's a shame.
Good soldiers dying for nothing,
all because they couldn't see the future.
Sad.
Look, still alive.
Change of heart?
Go back to whatever cave you crept out of.
You evil demoness!
Let's go see my palace.
Fear not, for you are found.
You are home, and there is no going back.
No one leaves this place.
But what is this place?
The answer is Sakaar.
Surrounded by cosmic gateways,
Sakaar lives on the edge of the known and unknown.
It is the collection point for all lost and unloved things.
Like you.
But here on Sakaar, you are significant.
You are valuable.
Here you are loved.
What the hell?
And no one loves you more than the Grandmaster.
He is the original, the first lost and the first found.
The creator of Sakaar,
and father of the Contest of Champions.
Where once you were nothing, now you are something.
You are the property of the Grandmaster.
Congratulations!
You will meet the Grandmaster in five seconds.
Prepare yourself.
Prepare yourself.
You are now meeting the Grandmaster.
He's wonderful. It is a he?
It is a he.
Yeah.
I love when you come to visit, 142.
You bring me the best stuff.
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, about Scrapper 142,
what do I always say? "She is the..." And it starts with a "B."
Trash.
No, not trash.
Were you waiting just to call her that? It doesn't start with a "B."
Booze hag.
I'm so sorry. No, "best." I was thinking about "best."
'Cause I always say you're the best.
She brought me my beloved champion, you know.
You say that every time she's here.
What have you brought today? Tell me.
A contender.
A what?
I need to go closer. I want to get a closer look at this.
Can you take us closer? Thank you.
Pay this lady.
Just wait a damn minute.
I'm not for sale.
Man, he's a fighter.
I take 10 million.
Tell her she's dreaming.
For heaven's sakes, transfer the units.
You'll pay for this.
No, I got paid for this.
Here's what I wanna know.
Who are you?
I am the God of Thunder.
I didn't hear any thunder, but out of your fingers, was that sparkles?
We've located your cousin.
Good!
Yeah, come on. I think you're gonna like this.
There he is.
Hey, cuz.
We almost couldn't find you. What, you been hiding?
Hi.
So...
Please.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Carlo...
I pardon you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're officially pardoned. From life.
Help me.
Oh, my God!
I'm stepping in it. I'm stepping in it. Look!
The smell.
What does it smell like?
Burnt toast.
What happened to my manners?
I haven't properly introduced myself.
Come on. Follow me.
My name is Grandmaster.
I preside over a little harlequinade called the Contest of Champions.
People come from far and wide to unwillingly participate in it.
And you, my friend, might just be part of the new cast.
What do you say to that?
We're not friends and I don't give a shit about your games.
I'm going back to Asgard.
Ass-gard.
One, two, three, four.
There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me.
At that moment, I let go.
Loki?
Loki! Loki!
Over here. Over here.
- Excuse me one second. - Loki!
- What? - You're alive?
- Yes, of course I'm alive. - What are you doing here?
What do you mean, what am I doing? I'm stuck in this stupid chair.
- Where's your chair? - I didn't get a chair.
- Get me out of this one. Get me out. - I can't.
- I can't. - What?
I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.
- He's crazy! - I've gained his favor.
The Bifrost brought me out here weeks ago.
- Weeks ago? - Yes.
I just got here.
What are you whispering about?
Time works real different around these parts.
On any other world, I'd be, like, millions of years old.
But here on Sakaar...
In any case, you know this...
You call yourself Lord of Thunder?
God of Thunder. Tell him.
I've never met this man in my life.
- He's my brother. - Adopted.
Is he any kind of a fighter?
You take this thing out of my neck and I'll show you.
Now, listen to that. He's threatening me.
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.
If you wanna get back to Ass-place, Assberg...
Asgard.
Any contender who defeats my champion,
their freedom they shall win.
Fine. Then point me in the direction of whoever's ass I have to kick!
That's what I call, contender.
Direction would be this way, Lord.
Loki!
Hey. Take it easy, man.
Over here.
The pile of rocks waving at you. Here.
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. I'm a being.
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Korg. I'm kind of like the leader in here.
I'm made of rocks, as you can see. But don't let that intimidate you.
You don't need to be afraid unless you're made of scissors.
Just a little rock-paper-scissor joke for you.
This is my very good friend over here, Miek.
He's an insect and has knives for hands.
You're a Kronan, aren't you?
- That I am. - How'd you end up in here?
Well, I tried to start a revolution, but didn't print enough pamphlets.
So hardly anyone turned up, except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate.
As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator.
Bit of a promotional disaster, that one.
But I'm actually organizing another revolution.
I don't know if you'd be interested in something like that.
Do you reckon you'd be interested?
How did you...
Yeah, no. This whole thing is a circle.
But not a real circle, more like a freaky circle.
- This doesn't make any sense. - No, nothing makes sense here, man.
The only thing that does make sense is that nothing makes sense.
Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster's champion?
Doug has.
Doug!
Our luck, Doug's dead.
That's right.
Everyone who fights the Grandmaster's champion perishes.
What about you? You're made of rocks.
Perishable rock. There you go. Another one gone.
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller fights, warm up the crowd and whatnot.
Wait. You're not gonna face him, are you?
Yes, I am.
Gonna fight him, win, and get the hell out of this place.
That's exactly what Doug used to say.
See you later, new Doug.
Does no one remember me?
Has no one been taught our history?
Look at these lies.
Goblets and garden parties?
Peace treaties?
Odin...
Proud to have it,
ashamed of how he got it.
We were unstoppable.
I was his weapon in the conquest that built Asgard's empire.
One by one, the realms became ours.
But then, simply because my ambition outgrew his,
he banished me, caged me, locked me away like an animal.
Before that, Asgard's warriors were honored,
their bodies buried as heroes beneath this very palace.
- Odin's treasures. - Fake.
Most of the stuff in here is fake.
Or weak.
Smaller than I thought it would be.
That's not bad.
But this...
The Eternal Flame.
Want to see what true power really looks like?
Fenris, my darling, what have they done to you?
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
I've missed you.
I've missed you all.
Odin,
I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla,
where the brave shall live forever.
Nor shall we mourn but rejoice,
for those that have died the glorious death.
Hurts, doesn't it?
Being lied to.
Being told you're one thing and then learning it's all a fiction.
You didn't think I'd really come and see you, did you?
This place is disgusting.
Does this mean you don't want my help?
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my position with the Grandmaster.
It took me time to win his trust. He's a lunatic, but he can be amenable.
What I'm telling you is, you could join me at the Grandmaster's side.
Perhaps, in time, an accident befalls the Grandmaster, and then...
You're not seriously thinking of going back, are you?
Our sister destroyed your hammer like a piece of glass.
She's stronger than both of us. She's stronger than you.
You don't stand a chance.
Do you understand what I'm saying here?
Fine.
I guess I'll just have to go it alone.
Like I've always done.
Would you say something?
Say something!
What would you like me to say?
You faked your own death,
you stole the throne, stripped Odin of his power,
stranded him on Earth to die, releasing the Goddess of Death.
Have I said enough or would you like me to go back further than the past two days?
You know, I haven't seen this beloved champion he talks of,
but I've heard he is astonishingly savage.
I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow.
Don't let me down.
Piss off, ghost!
He's freaking gone.
Yuck!
There's still someone's hair and blood all over this.
Guys, can you clean up the weapons once you finish your fight?
Disgusting slobs.
Thor,
wanna use a big wooden fork?
No.
Yeah, not really useful.
Unless you're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together.
I really wish I had my hammer.
Hammer?
Quite unique.
It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star.
And when I spun it really, really fast, it gave me the ability to fly.
You rode a hammer?
No, I didn't ride the hammer.
The hammer rode you on your back?
No. I used to spin it really fast, and it would pull me off the...
Oh, my God. A hammer pulled you off?
The ground. It would pull me off the ground, up into the air, and I would fly.
Every time I threw it, it would always come back to me.
Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship with this hammer
and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one.
That's a nice way of putting it.
I said they're mine.
See her, that's the one that put me in here.
Yeah. Scrapper 142.
Gotta watch out for those Asgardians, man.
They are hard to perish.
Asgardian?
Hey.
Hey.
Hey.
Do not zap me with that thing. I just wanna talk.
Asgard is in danger.
My God, you're a Valkyrie.
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was younger,
until I found out that you were all women.
There's nothing wrong with women, of course. I love women.
Sometimes a little too much.
Not in a creepy way, just more of a respectful appreciation.
I think it's great that there is an elite force of women warriors.
It's about time.
Are you done?
Lord of Thunder, you're up.
Please, help me. I need your help.
Bye.
Fine, then you must be a traitor or a coward.
Because the Valkyrie is sworn to protect the throne.
Listen closely, your majesty. This is Sakaar, not Asgard.
And I'm a Scrapper, not a Valkyrie.
Bring him in for processing.
And no one escapes this place. So you're gonna die anyway.
Now, don't you move.
My hands ain't as steady as they used to be.
By Odin's beard, you shall not cut my hair,
lest you feel the wrath of the mighty Thor.
Please. Please, kind sir, do not cut my hair.
Please! No!
No!
Look at all of you. What a show! What a night!
Who's having fun?
Please, I'm your host.
Big round of applause for all of our undercard competitors,
who today died so gruesomely.
Good sports.
What a show! What a night!
This is what you've come for, and so have I.
And now, without further ado,
it's main event time.
Making his first appearance, though he looks quite promising,
got a couple of tricks up his sleeve.
I'll say no more, see what you think.
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
Lord of Thunder.
Watch out for his fingers. They make sparks.
Okay, this is it.
Let's get ready to welcome this guy. Here he comes.
He is a creature.
What can we say about him?
Well, he's unique. There's none like him.
I feel a special connection with him.
He's undefeated.
He's the reigning.
He's the defending.
Ladies and gentlemen...
I give you...
Your Incredible...
Hulk!
Yes!
I have to get off this planet.
Hey, hey, hey. Where you going?
Hey!
We know each other.
He's a friend from work.
Where have you been?
Everybody thought you were dead.
But so much has happened since I last saw you.
I lost my hammer.
Like, yesterday, so that's still pretty fresh.
Loki. Loki's alive. Can you believe it?
He's up there.
Loki! Look who it is!
Banner, I never thought I would say this,
but I'm happy to see you.
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!
Banner.
Hey, Banner!
No Banner. Only Hulk.
What are you doing?
It's me. It's Thor!
Banner, we're friends.
This is crazy. I don't want to hurt you!
Here we go.
What?
Hey, big guy.
The sun's getting real low.
That's it. The sun's going down.
I won't hurt you anymore.
No one will.
Yes!
That's how it feels!
I'm just a huge fan of the sport.
All right. Screw it.
I know you're in there, Banner. I'll get you out!
What's the matter with you? You're embarrassing me!
I told them we were friends!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!
Another day, another Doug.
What is that noise?
The common folk aren't exactly falling in line.
There's a resistance trying to knock down the front gates.
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.
Well, me dad was a stonemason. Me mum was...
Right, yeah, I'll just stop you there. What I meant was,
what's your ambition?
I just want a chance to prove myself.
Recognition.
When I was young,
every great king had an executioner.
Not just to execute people,
but also to execute their vision.
But mainly to execute people.
Still, it was a great honor.
I was Odin's executioner.
And you shall be my executioner.
Let's begin our conquest.
Skurge, where's the sword?
That sword is the key to opening the Bifrost.
Those people you mentioned, the ones who aren't falling into line...
Round them up.
Excuse me.
Sorry about that. These bloody things are everywhere.
Come on.
You'll be safe here.
Are we cool?
It's Hulk in a hot tub.
So how long have you been like that?
Like what?
Like this. Big, and green, and stupid.
Hulk always Hulk.
How'd you get here?
Winning.
You mean cheating?
Were they wearing one of these when you won?
How'd you arrive here?
Quinjet.
Yes. Now, where is the Quinjet now?
That's naked.
He's very naked.
It's in my brain now.
Quinjet.
Yes!
I'm getting us out of here.
This terrible, awful place.
You're gonna love Asgard. It's big. It's golden. Shiny.
Hulk stay.
No, no, no. My people need me to get back to Asgard.
We must prevent Ragnarok.
Ragnarok?
The prophesied death of my home world. The end of days, it's the end of...
If you help me get back to Asgard,
I can help you get back to Earth.
Earth hate Hulk.
Earth loves Hulk. They love you.
You're one of the Avengers. One of the team, one of our friends.
This is what friends do. They support each other.
You're Banner's friend.
I'm not Banner's friend. I prefer you.
Banner's friend.
I don't even like Banner.
"I'm into numbers and science and stuff."
Thor go. Hulk stay.
Fine.
Stay here.
Stupid place. It's hideous, by the way.
The red, the white. Just pick a color. Ridiculous.
Smash you.
You didn't smash anything. I won that fight.
- I smashed you. - Yeah, sure, sure.
- Baby arms. - What?
Baby.
Moron! You big child.
Thor go!
I am going.
Thor go again.
Thor home.
Hulk trains.
That's great. Have fun.
- Hey, big guy. - Angry girl.
What have you been up to?
Winning.
Heimdall, I know you can see me.
I need you to help me.
Help me see.
I see you, but you're far away.
What's going on here?
Come see for yourself.
I'm providing refuge in a stronghold built by our ancestors.
But if the garrison falls, our only escape is Bifrost.
You're talking about evacuating Asgard?
We won't last long if we stay.
She draws her power from Asgard and grows stronger every day.
Come on.
Hela is ravenous.
If I let her leave, she'll consume Nine Realms and all the cosmos.
We need you.
I'm working on it. But I don't even know where the hell I am.
You're on a planet surrounded by doorways. Go through one.
- Which one? - The big one.
Thor sad.
Shut up.
Thor sad.
I'm not sad, you idiot.
I'm pissed off!
Angry. I lost my father.
I lost my hammer.
- Whining and crying. Cry like baby. - You're not even listening.
Don't kick stuff.
You're being a really bad friend.
You bad friend!
- You know what we call you? - No.
We call you the stupid Avenger.
You're tiny Avenger!
What, are you crazy?
Yes.
You know what? Earth does hate you.
No.
I'm sorry I said those things.
You're not the stupid Avenger. Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger.
It's okay.
You just can't go around throwing shields at people. Could have killed me.
I know. I'm sorry. I just get so angry all the time.
Hulk always, always angry.
I know. We're the same, you and I.
We're just a couple of hot-headed fools.
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, Thor like water.
We're kind of both like fire.
But Hulk like real fire.
Hulk like raging fire.
Thor like smoldering fire.
Hulk, I need you to do something for me.
Angry girl.
What's going on? What are you...
You're so thick-headed that you can't tell
when someone's hiding all the way across the universe and wants to be left alone?
- We need to talk. - No, you wanna talk to me.
I need her to stay.
Stay?
Block.
Stay.
- Please. - Please.
All right.
Here's the deal.
I'll listen to you
till this is empty.
Asgard is in danger and people are dying.
We need to get back there. I need your help.
Finished. Bye.
Odin is dead.
Hela, the Goddess of Death, has invaded Asgard.
If Hela's back, then Asgard's already lost.
I'm going to stop her.
- Alone? - Nope.
I'm putting together a team.
It's me, you, and the big guy.
No. No team. Only Hulk.
It's me and you.
I think it's only you.
Please, listen. The Valkyrie are legend.
Elite warriors of Asgard sworn to defend the throne.
I'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin's family squabbles.
- What's that supposed to mean? - Your sister.
Her power comes from Asgard, same as yours.
When it grew beyond Odin's control she massacred everyone in the palace
and tried to seize the throne.
When she tried to escape her banishment
he sent the Valkyrie in to fight her back.
I only survived because...
Look, I already faced her once back when I believed in the throne,
and it cost me everything.
That's what's wrong with Asgard.
The throne, the secrets, the whole golden sham.
I agree.
Don't get familiar.
I agree.
That's why I turned down the throne.
But this isn't about the crown. This is about the people.
They're dying and they're your people, too.
Forget it.
I have.
- Okay. - Okay.
- Good. Great. - Great.
Thank you.
- For what? - For this.
Didn't see that, did you?
There... That's better.
You know, go ahead.
Stay here and enslave people for that lunatic.
Keep drinking, keep hiding.
But me...
I choose to run toward my problems and not away from them.
Because that's what...
Because that's what heroes do.
Friend stay!
Yes!
All right.
Come on.
Welcome. Voice activation required.
Thor.
Access denied.
Thor, son of Odin.
Access denied.
God of Thunder.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Strongest Avenger.
Access denied.
Damn you, Stark.
Point Break.
Welcome, Point Break.
Friend stay!
No, no, no!
Stop!
Stay!
Hulk, stop breaking everything!
Don't go!
Nice work, big guy.
We don't know where Ultron's headed, but you're going very high, very fast.
So, I need you to turn this bird around, okay?
We can't track you in stealth mode,
so I need you to help me out. Okay?
I need you to...
No! No, Banner!
Oh, jeez.
Banner.
Hey, hey, hey.
You all right, Banner?
Sun's going down. Sun's going down.
That's it, breathe.
I won't hurt you.
Sun's going down.
- Thor. - Yeah.
What happened to your hair?
Some creepy old man cut it off.
- It looks good. - Thanks.
Where are we? How's Nat?
- Nat is good, I'm sure. - Is she okay?
- And what about Sokovia? - Sokovia?
The city, Sokovia. Did we save it?
- Banner, listen. - What?
Sokovia. Ultron. That was two years ago.
What are you saying?
What?
I've been Hulk for two years?
I'm afraid so.
What the hell happened?
Banner, there's something you should know.
Voice activation required.
Banner.
Welcome, strongest Avenger.
What?
Ship's log.
Thor, where are we?
Yeah, about that.
Sakaar, hear ye. Attention please. I have some bad news.
My beloved exalted champion has turned up missing.
Take to the streets. Celebrate my champion.
Who's that?
He kind of runs the place.
You actually lived at his house for awhile.
- I did? - Yeah.
Quite a lot's happened. You and I had a fight recently.
- Did I win? - No, I won. Easily.
Doesn't sound right.
Well, it's true.
It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away.
Seductive God of Thunder. We need to move.
Oh, no.
This is bad.
This is really, really bad.
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.
No, no, no.
Don't freak out. You're okay. Put these on.
These are Tony's clothes.
- I know, come on. - Is he here?
No, he's not here. But listen. Just stay calm, okay?
The sun's going down. The sun's getting really low. Sun's going down.
I'm upset!
I'm very upset.
You know what I like about being upset? The blame.
Right now, that's the mindset that I'm in. And you know who I'm blaming?
- Grandmaster, I can... - Hey!
Don't interrupt me!
Here you go.
Why are you handing me the melt stick?
He was interrupting.
That's not a capital violation.
Where was I?
My precious champion has come up missing,
and it's all because of that Lord of Thunder. It's all because of him.
Your brother.
Whatever the story is. Adopted, or complicated, or you know.
I'm sure there's a big history.
And your contender...
My dear friend,
if you were to give me 12 hours, I could bring them both back to you. Alive.
I could do it in two.
I could do it in one.
Let's stop there.
You know what? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution.
But for now, I'll settle for this sweet little
"Who's gonna get him first?"
So, you're on the clock.
What have you done?
I don't answer to you, lackey.
It's Loki.
And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
Why would you help my brother escape with that green fool?
I don't help anyone.
You're a Valkyrie.
I thought the Valkyrie had all died gruesome deaths.
Choose your next words wisely.
I'm terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory.
The sun's going down. It's getting really low.
The sun's going down. It's getting real low.
Oh, shoot.
- Sun's getting low. - Would you stop saying that?
I just need you to stay calm.
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!
It's just a planet. You've been on a planet before.
Yeah. One.
Now you've been on two. That's a good thing.
It's a new experience.
My neurons, they're firing faster than my brain can handle the information.
The whole thing is totally different this time.
In the past, I always felt like Hulk and I each had a hand on the wheel.
But this time, it's like he had the keys to the car and I was locked in the trunk.
All right, well, you're back now. That's all that matters.
No, it's not what matters.
What I'm trying to tell you, is that if I turn into the Hulk again,
Banner may never come back.
And we're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out.
We're not stranded. I'm gonna figure out a way to get us home.
Thank you.
Not your home, though. Asgard. My home.
What?
Listen, my people are in great danger.
You and I, we have to fight this really powerful being,
who also happens to be my sister.
Okay, that is so wrong on so many...
I don't wanna fight your sister. That's a family issue.
No, she's an evil being.
I don't care what she is.
I'm not fighting any more beings. I'm sick of it.
- What? - I just told you.
If I turn into the Hulk, I am never gonna come back again.
And you don't care.
No, no. I'm putting together the team.
The Hulk is the fire.
Wait, you're just using me to get to the Hulk.
- What? No! - It's gross.
You don't care about me. You're not my friend.
No! I don't even like the Hulk. He's all like...
"Smash, smash, smash."
I prefer you.
Thanks.
But if I'm being honest, when it comes to fighting evil beings,
he is very powerful and useful.
Yeah, Banner's powerful and useful, too.
Is he though?
How many PhDs does Hulk have? Zero.
How many PhDs does Banner have? Seven.
Fine, you don't have to fight anyone.
But we're in danger here, so we have to move.
What are you doing with that?
I need a disguise. I'm a fugitive.
- I need a disguise. - You are the disguise.
- I'll be Tony Stark. - What?
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.
No, no, you're not Tony. You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.
Then why did you dress me up like Tony?
Because you were naked.
Okay, I'll give you that.
What are you doing? Stop doing that!
Tony wears his pants super tight.
- Stop it! - I'm sorry.
- Why are you being so weird? - I don't know.
Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years
inside of a monster made me a little weird.
Hey. It's okay.
You're good. Calm down. Come on.
Listen, we're gonna go to Asgard
and you're not gonna have to think about the Hulk ever again. All right?
All right.
This is bad.
Banner! Banner!
Banner!
Banner!
Thor!
Hi.
Hi.
I was gonna do that.
Yeah, well, I did it first.
That's good. What are you doing here?
What are you doing here? I thought you were leaving.
I got sidetracked.
What's with the...
It's my disguise.
But I can see your face.
Not when I do this, you can't.
Your hair looks nice. I like what you did with it. Change it? Washed it maybe?
What are those things on her eyes? Are those people that she's killed?
She's so beautiful and strong and courageous.
Who is this guy?
- He's a friend. - Who? Me?
- I'm Bruce. - I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too.
Look, I've spent years in a haze, trying to forget my past.
Sakaar seemed like the best place to drink and forget, and to die one day.
I was thinking that you drink too much, and that probably was gonna kill you.
I don't plan to stop drinking.
But I don't wanna forget.
I can't turn away anymore,
so if I'm gonna die,
well, it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag.
- Good. - Yeah.
So, I'm saying that I wanna be on the team.
Has it got a name?
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.
Revengers?
Because I'm getting revenge. You're getting revenge.
Do you want revenge?
I'm undecided.
Okay.
Also, I've got a peace offering.
Surprise.
Just had to be sure.
Hello, Bruce.
So, last time I saw you, you were trying to kill everybody.
Where are you at these days?
It varies from moment to moment.
Is that a Dragonfang?
It is.
My God.
This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie.
So, Sakaar and Asgard are about as far apart as any two known systems.
Our best bet is a wormhole just outside of city limits.
Refuel on Xandar, and we can be back in Asgard in 18 months.
Nope. We are going through the big one.
The Devil's Anus?
Anus?
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?
For the record, I didn't know it was called that when I picked it.
That looks like a collapsing neutron star
inside of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
We need another ship. That will tear mine to pieces.
She's right. We need one that can
withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity.
And has an offline power steering system
that could also function without the onboard computer.
And we need one with cup holders, because we're gonna die. So, drinks!
Do I know you? I feel like I know you.
I feel like I know you, too. It's weird.
What do you say?
Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway.
Talk about an adventure.
- We need a ship. - Need a ship.
There are one or two ships. Absolute top of the line models...
I don't mean to impose...
But the Grandmaster has a great many ships.
I may even have stolen the access codes to his security system.
And suddenly you're overcome with an urge to do the right thing.
Heavens, no.
I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster,
and in exchange for codes and access to a ship,
I'm asking for safe passage through the Anus.
You're telling us that you can get us access into the garage
without setting off any alarms?
Yes, brother. I can.
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI.
I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago
and he was totally ready to kill any of us.
He did try to kill me.
Yes, me too. On many, many occasions.
There was one time when we were children,
he transformed himself into a snake, and he knows that I love snakes.
So, I went to pick up the snake to admire it,
and he transformed back into himself and he was like, "Yeah, it's me!"
And he stabbed me. We were eight at the time.
If we're boosting a ship
we're gonna need to draw some guards away from the palace.
Why not set the beast loose?
Shut up.
You guys have a beast?
No, there's no beast. He's just being stupid.
We're going to start a revolution.
- Revolution? - I'll explain later.
- Who's this guy again? - I'll explain later.
Is that some sort of protoplasm, all the stuff that's coming out of you,
or are they eggs?
Looks like eggs.
I'm looking for Korg.
Who's asking?
I know you're asking.
Is there anyone else asking, or is it just you?
The Lord of Thunder sends his best.
The revolution has begun.
Revolution? How did this happen?
Don't know.
But the arena's mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated
and the slaves have armed themselves.
I don't like that word.
Which? Mainframe?
No. Why would I not like "mainframe"?
No, the "S" word.
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs have armed themselves.
Okay, that's better.
Hey, so, listen. We should talk.
I disagree.
Open communication was never our family's forte.
You have no idea.
Been quite the revelation since we last spoke.
Hello.
Hi.
Odin brought us together.
It's almost poetic that his death should split us apart.
We might as well be strangers now.
Two sons of the crown, set adrift.
Thought you didn't wanna talk about it.
Here's the thing.
I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
Did you just agree with me?
Come on, this place is perfect for you.
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...
Brother, you're gonna do great here.
Do you truly think so little of me?
Loki, I thought the world of you.
I thought we were gonna fight side by side forever.
But at the end of the day, you're you and I'm me.
I don't know, maybe there's still good in you.
But let's be honest, our paths diverged a long time ago.
Yeah.
It's probably for the best that we never see each other again.
It's what you always wanted.
Hey, let's do "Get Help."
- What? - "Get Help."
No.
- Come on, you love it. - I hate it.
- It's great. It works every time. - It's humiliating.
- Do you have a better plan? - No.
We're doing it.
We are not doing "Get Help."
Get help! Please!
My brother, he's dying.
Get help! Help him!
Classic.
Still hate it.
- It's humiliating. - Not for me, it's not.
Now, which one's the ship she told us to get?
The Commodore.
Right.
Though I feel it won't make much of a difference.
Loki.
I know I've betrayed you many times before,
but this time it's truly nothing personal.
The reward for your capture will set me up nicely.
Never one for sentiment, were you?
Easier to let it burn.
I agree.
That looks painful.
Dear brother, you're becoming predictable.
I trust you, you betray me.
Round and round in circles we go.
See, Loki, life is about... It's about growth.
It's about change.
But you seem to just wanna stay the same.
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that you'll always be the God of Mischief,
but you could be more.
I'll just put this over here for you.
Anyway, all got places to be, so good luck.
All right, I can figure this out.
It's just another spaceship.
Loyal Sakaarians,
Lord of Thunder has stolen my ship and my favorite champion.
Sakaarians, take to the skies. Bring him down.
Do not let him leave this planet.
- Good shot! - Thanks.
Open the doors.
Okay.
I hope that you're tougher than you look.
Why?
Shouldn't we be shooting back or something?
Yes, we should.
Where are the guns on this ship?
There aren't any.
- It's a leisure vessel. - What?
Grandmaster uses it for his good times, orgies and stuff.
Did she just say the Grandmaster uses it for orgies?
Yeah.
Don't touch anything.
No!
- No! - No!
Get inside!
In a minute.
I should probably go and help. Here, take the wheel.
No. I don't know how to fly one of these.
You're a scientist. Use one of your PhDs.
None of them are for flying alien spaceships!
Okay, come on.
There's gotta be a gun on this thing.
That looks like a gun.
It's my birthday It's my birthday
It's my birthday
Yeah!
Guys, we're coming up on the Devil's Anus!
There she is.
Our ticket out of here.
Hey, what's this?
Thank you.
Hey, man. We're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship.
You wanna come?
You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.
Why, thank you.
Here we go.
Shit.
Asgardians...
Some misguided soul
has stolen the Bifrost sword.
Tell us where it is
or there will be consequences.
Bad ones.
Well?
You.
Well? Executioner?
Wait!
Wait!
I know where the sword is.
I never thought I'd be back here.
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.
I mean, not that it's not nice. It's just, it's on fire.
Here, up here in the mountains.
Heat signatures. People clustered together.
She's coming for them.
Okay, drop me off at the palace and I'll draw her away.
And get yourself killed?
The people trapped down there are all that matters.
While I'm dealing with Hela, I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard.
How the hell are we supposed to do that?
I have a man on the ground.
Asgard.
She's here.
Now the ship has a gun.
I'll take it from here.
I found this in the armory.
Good luck.
Your Majesty...
Don't die.
You know what I mean.
We must keep moving!
Go to the Bifrost!
Sister.
You're still alive.
I love what you've done with the place. Redecorating, I see.
It seems our father's solution to every problem was to cover it up.
Or to cast it out.
He told you you were worthy. He said the same thing to me.
You see?
You never knew him.
Not at his best.
Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears.
Where do you think all this gold came from?
And then, one day,
he decided to become a benevolent king.
To foster peace, to protect life.
To have you.
I understand why you're angry.
And you are my sister, and technically have a claim to the throne.
And believe me, I would love for someone else to rule.
But it can't be you.
You're just the worst.
Okay, get up.
You're in my seat.
You know, Father once told me
that a wise king never seeks out war.
But must always be ready for it.
Go back!
Go!
To be honest, I expected more.
Heimdall!
The sword!
Here's the difference between us.
I'm Odin's firstborn,
the rightful heir, the savior of Asgard.
And you're nothing.
So simple, even a blind man could see it.
Now you remind me of Dad.
The stupid dog won't die!
Everything's gonna be all right now. I got this.
You wanted to know who I am?
What the hell are you talking about?
You'll see!
You see? No one's going anywhere.
I'll get that sword,
even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it.
Hey, man.
I'm Korg. This is Miek.
We're gonna jump on that spaceship and get out of here. Wanna come?
Your savior is here.
Did you miss me?
Everyone, on that ship now.
Welcome home. I saw you coming.
Of course you did.
It's a valiant effort, but you never stood a chance.
You see...
I'm not a queen or a monster.
I'm the Goddess of Death.
What were you the god of, again?
Even when you had two eyes,
you'd see only half the picture.
She's too strong. Without my hammer, I can't.
Are you Thor, the God of Hammers?
That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it.
It was never your source of strength.
It's too late. She's already taken Asgard.
Asgard is not a place. Never was.
This could be Asgard.
Asgard is where our people stand.
Even now, right now, those people need your help.
I'm not as strong as you.
No...
You're stronger.
Tell me, brother.
What were you the god of, again?
- You're late. - You're missing an eye.
This isn't over.
I think we should disband the Revengers.
Hit her with a lightning blast.
I just hit her with the biggest lightning blast in the history of lightning.
It did nothing.
We just need to hold her off until everyone's on board.
It won't end there.
The longer Hela's on Asgard, the more powerful she grows.
She'll hunt us down.
We need to stop her here and now.
So what do we do?
I'm not doing "Get Help."
Asgard's not a place, it's a people.
Loki,
this was never about stopping Ragnarok.
This was about causing Ragnarok.
Surtur's crown, the vault.
It's the only way.
Bold move, brother.
Even for me.
Shall we?
After you.
This is madness.
Go! Go, now!
For Asgard.
Hela!
With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn.
Hela, enough!
You want Asgard, it's yours.
Whatever game you're playing, it won't work.
You can't defeat me.
No, I know.
But he can.
No.
Tremble before me, Asgard!
I am your reckoning!
The people are safe.
That's all that matters.
We're fulfilling the prophecy.
I hate this prophecy.
So do I, but we have no choice.
Surtur destroys Asgard,
he destroys Hela, so that our people may live.
But we need to let him finish the job, otherwise...
No!
Hulk, stop, you moron!
Hulk, stop.
Just for once in your life, don't smash.
Big monster!
Let's go!
Fine.
I am Asgard's doom!
The damage is not too bad.
As long as the foundations are still strong,
we can rebuild this place.
It will become a haven
for all peoples and aliens of the universe.
Now those foundations are gone. Sorry.
What have I done?
You saved us from extinction.
Asgard is not a place...
It's a people.
It suits you.
Maybe you're not so bad after all, brother.
Maybe not.
Thank you.
If you were here, I might even give you a hug.
I'm here.
Your throne.
So, King of Asgard.
Where to?
I'm not sure.
Any suggestions?
Miek, where are you from?
Miek's dead.
Yeah, no, I accidentally stomped on him on the bridge.
I've just felt so guilty, I've been carrying him around all day.
Miek, you're alive!
He's alive, guys. What was your question again, bro?
Earth it is.
Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?
Yes, of course. The people of Earth love me. I'm very popular.
Let me rephrase that.
Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth?
Probably not, to be honest.
I wouldn't worry, brother. I feel like everything's gonna work out fine.
Oh, boy.
I just gotta say, I'm proud of you all.
This revolution has been a huge success. Yay, us!
Pat on the back. Pat on the back.
Come on. No?
Me too. 'Cause I've been a big part of it.
Can't have a revolution without somebody to overthrow.
So, you're welcome.
And it's a tie.

Long before the birth of light, there was darkness.
And from that darkness came the Dark Elves.
Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith
sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.
Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether,
an ancient force of infinite destruction.
Malekith.
Asgard's forces are upon us.
The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor,
waged a mighty war against these creatures.
Send in the Cursed!
As the Nine Worlds converged above him,
Malekith could at last unleash the Aether.
Ahh!
But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp.
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.
With the battle all but lost,
Malekith sacrificed his own people
in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.
Their deaths will mean our survival.
This war is far from over.
Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more.
Or so we were led to believe.
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?
If only we could.
But its power is too great.
Bury it deep.
Somewhere no one will ever find it.
Loki.
Hello, Mother.
Have I made you proud?
Please, don't make this worse.
Define "worse."
Enough!
I will speak to the prisoner alone.
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,
and death.
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God.
Just like you.
We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die.
Just as humans do.
Give or take 5,000 years.
All this because Loki desires a throne.
It is my birthright.
Your birthright was to die
as a child.
Cast out onto a frozen rock.
If I had not taken you in,
you would not be here now to hate me.
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,
just swing it.
It's not that I don't love our little talks,
it's just...
I don't love them.
Frigga is the only reason you're still alive,
and you will never see her again.
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
And what of Thor?
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains.
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done.
He will bring order to the Nine Realms
and then, yes...
He will be king.
- Ah!
I've got this completely under control!
Is that why everything is on fire?
Ah!
You're welcome.
Ha!
All yours.
Hello.
I accept your surrender.
Anyone else?
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.
Keep moving. Come on!
Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!
Where do we go next?
Hogan, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.
You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is.
Asgard can wait.
You have my thanks.
As you have mine.
Heimdall, when you're ready.
Is Vanaheim secure?
As are Nornheim and Ria.
Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.
You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.
That was not my intent.
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,
the Nine Realms are at peace.
They're well reminded of our strength
and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.
Thank you.
Nothing out of order
except your confused and distracted heart.
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,
but as your father.
You are ready.
The time has come for you to take the throne.
Embrace and celebrate what you've won.
Join your warriors.
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.
Another!
There was a time when you would celebrate for weeks.
I remember you celebrated the Battle of Harokin
so much that you nearly started the second.
Well, the first was so much fun.
Take a drink with me.
Surely, the Allfather could have no further task for you tonight.
No, this is one I set myself.
It does not go unnoticed that you disappear each night.
There are nine realms.
The future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.
I thank you for your sword
and for your counsel good Lady.
Hi.
Hi.
So, what's the story with you?
Why does there have to be a story? There's no story.
You spent the first ten minutes of our date
hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it.
It's either chicken, vegetarian, or fish, Jane.
I think there's a story
and I'm thinking the story involves a guy.
It's complicated.
Is he still around?
No, he...
Went away.
I've been there.
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?
I was seeing a woman
and she took a job in New York.
Eventually, the distance killed it.
And the fact that she kept sleeping with other dudes.
- No! - Oh, so many.
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?
Sure, I'd love some.
Richard, this is Darcy.
What are you doing here?
Oh. Hello.
So, I show up to work at the lab your mom's house,
fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas,
eating ice cream and obsessing about...
You know who.
Ah.
But you're not. You're wearing lady clothes.
You even showered, didn't you? You smell good.
Is there a point to all this?
Because there really needs to be a point to all this.
Right.
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?
You might want to start looking at it again.
This is the reason we came all the way out here.
It's malfunctioning.
That's what I said.
That's what I did.
I thought you would do something a little more scientific.
- I'm sure it's nothing. - Yeah, it's...
it doesn't look like nothing.
It kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.
Our friend Erik
kind of went banana balls.
He's not interested.
- I'm not interested. - I'm interested.
It's time for you to go now.
Okay.
Short but sweet.
She needs help.
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.
Sea bass...
Sea bass.
Jane?
Maybe you should stop saying "sea bass"
and go after your friend.
This was so fun.
I'll just stay here and say "sea bass" alone.
And I hate you.
What? I said he was cute.
Just shut up and drive.
- You need to take the next left.
- Who's he? - He's my intern.
- You have an intern? - Oh, yeah.
Hello, Dr. Foster.
It's such a great honor to be working with you.
Right. I have to call Erik.
Oh, take a right.
And a left.
I have totally mastered driving in London.
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?
I came here because you said you were onto something, and then you vanish.
I'm here at Stonehenge
for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today.
The police were called to the scene
shortly after 11 A.M. this morning
after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area
then, decided to strip naked and effectively
terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment
whilst shouting that he was trying to save them.
The man, later identified as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig
has been called in for questioning by police.
Come on, this is exciting.
Look! The intern is excited.
"Ian."
Do you want the phase meter?
- No. - Bring the phase meter.
The toaster-looking thing.
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.
How do I change the ring-tone on this thing?
An astrophysicist with three degrees
should be able to change her own ring-tone.
Why are you calling me?
I didn't want to shout. Intern says it's this way.
- "Ian." My name is Ian. - Shh.
I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.
It's okay, we're Americans.
Is that supposed to make them like us?
- They'll make it go away. - Shh.
Oh, they're kids.
Are you the police?
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.
Thanks.
We just found it.
Can you show us?
That doesn't seem right.
Where'd it go?
That's...
That's incredible!
What happened?
Sometimes they come back.
Sometimes they don't.
I want to throw something!
Jane, give me your shoe.
I haven't seen readings like this since...
Since... New Mexico?
Don't touch anything!
Give me your shoe.
Oh.
Were those the car keys?
Whoa. Ah!
Oh!
Darcy!
Oh!
The Aether awakens us.
The Convergence returns.
You're late.
Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.
Perhaps.
How fare the stars?
Heimdall Still shining.
From here, I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.
Do you recall what I taught you of the Convergence?
Yes.
The alignment of the worlds.
It approaches, doesn't it?
The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began.
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.
But while its effects can be dangerous,
it is truly beautiful.
I see nothing.
Or, perhaps, that is not the beauty you seek.
How is she?
She's quite clever, your mortal.
She doesn't know it yet,
but she studies the Convergence as well.
Even.
What?
I can't see her.
Jane!
Where the hell were you?
Tell me you didn't call the police.
What was I supposed to do?
- Not call the police. - I was freaking out.
You call the cops, they call the Feds.
Next thing you know, we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over.
- "Area 51-ing" the place. - Jane.
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.
We had unimpeded access.
Our only competition was ten years old!
Jane! You were gone for five hours.
What?
That's weird.
Typical.
Jane.
Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real.
It's been a very strange day.
I am. Jane, what...
Where were you?
Where were you?
Heimdall cannot see you.
I was right here where you left me.
I was waiting, and then I was crying
and then I went out looking for you.
You said you were coming back.
I know. I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.
Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging.
I had to put an end to the slaughter.
As excuses go, it's not terrible.
But I saw you on TV. You were in New York!
Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world
but I was wrong.
I was a fool.
But I believe that fate brought us together.
Jane, I don't know where you were, or what happened, but I do know this...
What?
I know...
You do?
Do what?
What?
Hey!
Is this you?
Uh, we're kind of in the middle of something here.
Um, I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.
Hold that thought.
Look at you, still all muscly and everything.
How's space?
Space is fine.
Excuse me.
- Are you Jane Foster? - Yes.
Do you know this man?
He's my intern.
My intern's intern.
This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you.
You'll have to come with me.
Jane.
- Jane. - Thor?
Are you all right?
What just happened?
Place your hands on your heads. Step back.
This woman is unwell.
She's dangerous.
So am I.
Requesting armed response officers to scene.
- Hold on to me. - What are you doing?
Holy shit.
We have to do that again.
Hi.
Welcome to Asgard.
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.
I can barely remember a time before the light.
Our survival will be your legacy.
The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered.
I will reclaim the Aether.
I will restore our world.
And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.
What's that?
Be still.
This is not of Earth. What is it?
We do not know.
But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.
That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?
It's a soul forge.
Does a soul forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?
Yes.
Quantum field generator.
My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?
She is ill.
She is mortal.
Illness is their defining trait.
I brought her here because we can help her.
She does not belong here in Asgard
any more than a goat belongs at a banquet table.
Did he just... Who do you think you are?
I am Odin, King of Asgard.
Protector of the Nine Realms.
Oh. Well, I'm...
I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.
You told your dad about me?
Something is within her, Father.
Something I have not seen before.
Her world has its healers.
They are called "doctors." Let them deal with it.
Guards, take her back to Midgard.
No, I would not...
touch her.
Jane, are you all right?
Yeah.
It's impossible.
The infection... It's defending her.
No.
It's defending itself.
Come with me.
There are relics that pre-date the universe itself.
What lies within her appears to be one of them.
The Nine Realms are not eternal.
They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.
But before that dawn
the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.
Born of eternal night
"the Dark Elves come to steal away the light."
I know these stories. Mother told them to us as children.
Their leader Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness
and it was called the Aether.
While the other relics often appear as stones
the Aether is fluid and ever changing.
It changes matter into dark matter.
It seeks out host bodies, drawing strength from their life-force.
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power
to return the universe to one of darkness.
But, after eternities of bloodshed
my father Bor finally triumphed
ushering in a peace that lasted thousands of years.
What happened?
He killed them all.
Are you certain?
The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them,
and yet here it is.
The Dark Elves are dead.
Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?
No.
It does not.
The worlds are nearly aligned.
You will be the last of the Kursed.
Let my life be sacrificed.
It is no less than our people did,
or you have done.
You will become darkness,
cursed to this existence until it consumes you.
Until then, no power our enemies possess can stop you.
I will tear down their defenses and ensure your return to a universe reborn.
Acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us.
Oh, please! If they were beneath you,
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.
- Keep in line! - Move it!
Odin continues to bring me new friends.
How thoughtful.
The books I sent, do they not interest you?
Is that how I am to while away eternity? Reading?
I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.
Have you?
Does Odin share your concern?
Does Thor?
It must be so inconvenient, them asking after me day and night.
You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
My actions?
I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life...
That I was born to be a king.
A king?
A true king admits his faults.
What of the lives you took on Earth?
A mere handful compared to the number
that Odin has taken himself.
- Your father... - He's not my father!
Then am I not your mother?
You're not.
You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.
When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.
Heimdall had lost sight of you.
You were no longer on Earth.
How is that possible?
I believe you were and you weren't.
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil
orbiting Midgard much the way your planets orbit the sun.
And every 5,000 years, the worlds align perfectly
and we call this the Convergence.
During this time, the borders between worlds become blurred.
It's possible you found one of these points.
We are lucky that it remained open.
Once the worlds pass out of alignment
then the connection is lost.
I like the way you explain things.
What's going to happen to me?
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.
- Your father said there was... - My father doesn't know everything.
Don't let him hear you say that.
Jane Foster... Please meet Frigga,
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.
Hi.
Move!
To the dungeons!
Come on!
You might want to take the stairs to the left.
The prisons.
- Loki... - Go.
I will look after her.
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!
- There's no pleasing some creatures.
Return to your cells, no further harm will come to you.
You have my word.
Very well, you do not have my word.
Send a squadron to the weapons vault.
Defend it at all costs. Secure the dungeon.
- Odin. - Frigga.
Go!
It's a skirmish.
Nothing to fear.
You've never been a very good liar.
Take her to your chambers.
I'll come for you when it's safe.
You take care.
Despite all I have survived,
my queen still worries over me.
It's only because I worry over you
that you have survived.
Listen to me now.
I need you to do everything I ask, no questions.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh!
- Ow! - Ah!
The throne of Asgard is destroyed! To the king!
Frigga.
Stand down, creature,
and you may still survive this.
I have survived worse, woman.
Who are you?
I am Malekith.
And I would have what is mine.
Ah!
You have taken something, child.
Give it back.
Witch!
Where is the Aether?
I'll never tell you.
I believe you.
No!
The universe rotates on a 5,000 year cycle
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.
Normally, they're separate.
But during the Alignment,
everything is connected, all nine realms.
All nine realms are passing through each other
and gravity, light, and even matter,
is crashing from one world to the other.
But if this happens to us now, the result will be cataclysmic.
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence.
This time, the Alignment
and all the other worlds would just pass us by.
It's beautiful.
It's simple. Any questions?
Yeah.
Can I have my shoe back?
Heal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.
And when you wake, we will kill them all.
Jane Foster?
You need to come with us.
We are still unable to restore the palace shields.
Our artillery cannot detect them.
Even Heimdall cannot see them.
My king, we are all but defenseless.
She's your prisoner now?
Leave us.
I do not wish to fight with you.
Nor I with you.
But I intend to pursue Malekith.
We possess the Aether.
Malekith will come to us.
Yes, and he will destroy us.
You overestimate the power of these creatures.
No, I value our people's lives.
I'll take Jane to the Dark World, and draw the enemy away from Asgard.
When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane,
it will be exposed and vulnerable.
And I will destroy it and him.
If you fail, you risk this weapon
falling into the hands of our enemies.
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.
His ship could be over our heads right now,
we would never even know it.
If and when he comes
his men will fall on 10,000 Asgardian blades.
And how many of our men shall fall on theirs?
As many as are needed!
Ah!
We Will fight!
Till the last Asgardian breath.
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.
Then how are you different from Malekith?
The difference, my son, is that I will win.
Jane isn't calling me back, Erik isn't calling me back,
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D. isn't calling me back.
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D? - It's a secret.
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.
Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard,
and I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
Something else went missing this week
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig
notable for his involvement in the alien invasion of New York
streaked nude across...
Darcy, you really need to look at this.
Your friend, Erik...
What was his last name again?
And began shouting at visitors to the historic site.
He was later taken into police custody
for psychiatric evaluation.
Police are still refusing to confirm...
You were not at Odin's war council.
The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders.
No one is to come or to go.
We face an enemy that is invisible even to me.
What use is a guardian such as that?
Malekith will return, you know this.
I need your help.
I cannot overrule my king's wishes. Not even for you.
I'm not asking you to.
The realms need their Allfather strong and unchallenged
whether he is or not.
But he is blinded, Heimdall
by hatred and by grief.
As are we all.
I see clearly enough.
The risks are too great.
Everything we do from here on is a risk.
There is no other way.
What do you require of me?
What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order.
Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death.
Malekith knew the Aether was here. He can sense its power.
If we do nothing, he will come for it again
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.
We must move Jane off-world.
The Bifrost has been shut down
and the Tesseract locked away in the vault.
There are other paths off Asgard. Ways known only to a few.
One, actually.
No.
Thor. After all this time
and now you come to visit me.
Why?
Have you come to gloat? To mock?
Loki, enough.
No more illusions.
Now you see me, brother.
Did she suffer?
I did not come here to share our grief.
Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Go on.
I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.
You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.
Vengeance and afterward, this cell.
You must be truly desperate to come to me for help.
What makes you think you can trust me?
I don't.
Mother did.
But you should know that when we fought each other in the past,
I did so with a glimmer of hope
that my brother was still in there somewhere.
That hope no longer exists to protect you.
You betray me, and I will kill you.
Hmm.
When do we start?
He will betray you.
He will try.
This is so unlike you, brother.
So clandestine.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?
If you keep speaking, I just might.
Fine. As you wish.
I'm not even here.
Is this better?
It's better company at least.
Still, we could be less conspicuous.
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.
It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.
Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions
given that you seem to like them so much.
Oh, this is much better.
Ooh.
The costume is a bit much. So tight.
But the confidence...
I can feel the righteousness surging.
Hey, do you want to have a rousing discussion about truth?
Honor? Patriotism?
God bless Amer...
What?
You could at least furnish me with a weapon.
My dagger, something.
At last.
A little common sense.
And I thought you liked tricks.
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of Einherjar
who will see you coming from Miles away.
I won't be the one who comes for her.
I'm not hungry.
What the... Good. Let's go.
You're...
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.
That was for New York.
I like her.
And what of the Allfather?
It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.
You called me here on an urgent matter.
What is it?
Treason, my lord.
Whose'?
Mine.
My king!
The mortal has been taken.
Stop Thor.
By any means necessary.
There they are! Take them.
On my command.
I'll hold them off. Take her.
Thank you.
Betray him, and I'll kill you.
It's good to see you, too, Sif.
Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal
what good would it do?
We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.
That, my friend, is why we won't be leaving by foot.
I will give you as much time as I can.
Thank you, my friend.
If you even think about betraying him...
You'll kill me?
Evidently, there will be a line.
I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.
I said, "How hard could it be?"
They're on the ship!
Get to the ship!
Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.
- Shut up, Loki.
You must have missed something.
No, I didn't. I'm pressing every button on this thing.
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.
I'm pressing it gently, it's networking!
Ha, ha!
Get him! Get him!
- I think you missed a column. - Shut up!
Look, why don't you let me take over?
I'm clearly the better pilot.
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,
which one can actually fly?
Oh, dear. Is she dead?
Jane.
I'm okay.
Ah!
Not a word.
Now they're following us.
Now they're firing at us.
Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki,
it's not at all distracting!
Well done. You just decapitated your grandfather.
You know, this is wonderful.
This is a tremendous idea.
Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe
and escape in that.
Flying around the city,
smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us.
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!
I see your time in the dungeons
has made you no less graceful, Loki.
You lied to me.
I'm impressed.
I'm glad you're pleased.
Now, do as you promised.
And take us to your secret pathway.
- Fandral. - Right.
For Asgard.
Nothing personal, boys.
Loki...
If it were easy, everyone would do it.
- Are you mad? - Possibly.
LON'. Ya-den!
We must strike now.
No.
Asgard is meaningless.
The Aether has found its way home.
What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.
It would consume you.
She's holding up all right.
For now.
She's strong in ways you'd never even know.
Say goodbye.
Not this day.
This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing.
It's a heartbeat.
You'll never be ready.
The only woman whose love you've prized
will be snatched from you.
And will that satisfy you?
Satisfaction is not in my nature.
Surrender is not in mine.
- The son of Odin... - No.
Not just of Odin.
You think you alone were loved of Mother?
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.
Trust?
Was that her last expression?
Trust? When you let her die?
- What help were you in your cell? - Who put me there?
Who put me there?
You know damn well!
- You know damn well who!
She wouldn't want us to fight.
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.
I wish I could trust you.
Trust my rage.
You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.
What?
Oh, yeah.
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.
One man's leather wallet, brown.
One key ring, three keys.
Prescription medicine...
Various.
- And... - Erik.
- These. - Yeah.
Those.
Thank goodness.
Erik.
Yes?
It's, uh, Darcy.
Darcy.
So good to see you.
Oh, I missed you, too.
How did you find me?
You were naked on TV.
Okay, time to go, lots to do.
Getting weird now.
I should not be left in charge of stuff like this.
I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid, period.
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.
Yeah, I don't get paid either.
Are you all right?
I've had a God in my brain.
- I don't recommend it.
Dr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping at me.
It's happening. It's sooner than I calculated.
Wait. What's happening?
Birds?
Birds are happening?
They're starlings. It's called a murmuration.
My dad, he used to take me bird watching as a kid.
- Nerd. - Look!
Where did they go?
What the hell was that?
Why are you smiling?
There's nothing more reassuring
than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.
Take me to Jane's lab.
Jane.
Malekith.
All right. Are you ready?
I am.
You know, this plan of yours is going to get us killed.
Yes, possibly.
You still don't trust me, brother?
Would you?
No, I wouldn't.
Thor!
No!
You really think I cared about Frigga?
About any of you?
All I ever wanted
was you and Odin dead at my feet!
Malekith!
I am Loki of Jotunheim,
- and I bring you a gift.
I ask only one thing in return...
A good seat from which
- to watch Asgard burn.
He is an enemy of Asgard.
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.
Look at me.
Loki! NOW!
Ah!
Ah!
- Ah! - No!
See you in hell, monster.
No. No, no, no.
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.
I know...
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.
Stay with me, okay?
I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Shh...
It's okay.
It's all right.
I'll tell Father what you did here today.
I didn't do it for him.
No!
He's going to unleash it.
Not just on Asgard, or on a star. Malekith is going to destroy everything.
How?
Jane, how?
I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?
The Convergence.
Oh, God.
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.
Then Malekith would've only possessed it
that much sooner.
I only found it because I was looking for you.
Jane.
Now we're trapped here.
It's not me.
Hello?
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.
Richard? Where are you?
I'm still at the office.
It's been a crazy day here today.
- Oh, my God, this is amazing. - Is it?
I quite enjoyed our lunch
despite never actually ordering anything.
How am I getting service here?
Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you later?
No, no, no. Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.
Okay, then.
I was just wondering if you want to try again.
Uh, maybe dinner next time.
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Just stay on the phone, okay? - Yeah, I will.
On, my God.
Am I interrupting something?
No, no, no. Nothing at all.
Come on.
I'm losing you there. Are you in a tunnel?
Where are we going?
Hello?
Why are there so many shoes in here?
I'll just text her.
So, who's Richard?
Really?
- Jane! - Hey.
You can't just leave like that.
The whole world is going crazy.
All the stuff we saw is spreading.
- Did you go to a party? - Erik?
Jane! How wonderful.
Oh!
- You've been to Asgard. - Where are your pants?
Oh, he, uh... He says it helps him think.
Okay, well, I'm going to need everything you got on this.
All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.
Okay.
- Are you well, Erik?
Your brother's not coming, is he?
Loki is dead.
Oh, thank God!
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.
Thank you.
Forgive me, my liege.
I've returned from the Dark World with news.
Thor?
There was no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but...
What?
We found a body.
Loki.
Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot
where all the nine worlds are connecting.
Amplifying the weapon's impact.
For each additional world,
the power will increase exponentially.
The effect would be universal.
But the Alignment is only temporary.
He must be in exactly the right place at the right time.
Well, how do we know where that is?
We follow the directions.
This has happened before
thousands of years ago, and the Ancients were there to see it.
All the great constructions,
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.
They made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence.
And they left us a map.
Stonehenge,
Snow-don, the Great Orme.
These are all coordinates taking us...
Here.
Greenwich?
The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent.
Physics is going to go ballistic.
Increases and decreases in gravity,
spatial extrusions.
The very fabric of reality is going to be torn apart.
I better get my pants.
Focus! This is important.
We have to hammer them in all around the site
and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.
They're taped together.
Do you even know what these things do?
Uh... No.
Neither do I.
Shh!
- Come on, come on, come on! - Right.
Holy... Shit.
Ah!
You needn't have come so far, Asgardian.
Death would've come to you soon enough.
Not by your hand.
Your universe was never meant to be.
Your world and your family
will be extinguished!
We're running out of time.
- Almost there. - Are you sure this is going to work?
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.
Oh, come on.
Come on, Darcy.
You know, with all that power,
I thought you'd hit harder.
Done.
The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight.
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.
That is awesome!
How did you do that?
Well, the gravitational fields
interact with the weak spots between worlds, creating...
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!
- Oops. - Let's go.
Um...
- What the hell just happened?
Move!
What are you all doing?
You need to get out of here, now!
You're joking, right?
That's Thor out there.
He's waving his hammer around and everything!
Ah!
Confirming ship is hostile.
Confirmed, ship is hostile.
You have permission to engage.
Roger.
Missiles locked.
Missiles away.
Missiles off target.
I repeat, target missed. I'm losing control.
Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.
What are you doing?
My signal's not connecting.
Jane!
Come on.
Are you all right?
You saved my life.
Yeah.
I guess I did.
Mmm.
Darcy?
- Jane!
- Ian! - Selvig!
Mew mew!
Mind the gap.
How do I get to Greenwich?
Take this train. Three stops.
Mind the gap.
Sorry. Sorry.
- We're out of time. - Jane.
Jane!
Thor!
We're too late.
The Convergence is at its peak.
Can those things stop him?
Not from here.
We can't get close enough.
I can.
Malekith!
Darkness returns, Asgardian.
Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
I've come to accept your surrender.
You think you can stop this?
The Aether cannot be destroyed.
But you can.
Thor! No.
Jane!
Ah!
Everybody okay?
He's gonna come back.
Except, you know,
last time he was gone for, like, two years.
Well, it's only been two days, so...
Did he say anything before he left?
Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father.
He kinda committed treason... On our way out.
Oh.
You once said there would never be a wiser king than me.
You were wrong.
The Alignment has brought all the realms together.
Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them.
What can Asgard offer its new king in return?
My life.
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.
I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath,
but I cannot do so from that chair.
Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will.
The brutality, the sacrifice...
It changes you.
I'd rather be a good man than a great king.
Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?
When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice?
This is not for Jane, Father.
She does not know what I came here to say.
Now, forbid me to see her, or say she can rule at my side.
It changes nothing.
One son who wanted the throne too much,
another who will not take it.
Is this my legacy?
Loki died with honor.
I shall try to live the same.
Is that not legacy enough?
It belongs to you.
If you are worthy of it.
I shall try to be.
I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
I know.
If I were proud of the man my son had become,
even that, I could not say.
It would speak only from my heart.
Go,
my son.
Thank you, Father.
No.
Thank you.
I present to you,
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.
Whoa...
Asgardians, it's an honor.
You know why we're here.
Of course.
But, if I may ask,
why not keep it secure in your own vault?
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.
It is not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
That's very wise.
I can assure you,
it will be absolutely safe here,
in my collection.
See that it is.
One down.
Five to go.

(BEEPING)
Wait for it.
- Can I turn on the radio? - No.
ERIK: Jane, you can't keep doing this.
The last 17 occurrences have been predictable to the second.
ERIK: Jane, you're an astrophysicist, not some storm chaser.
JANE: I'm telling you, there's a connection
between these atmospheric disturbances and my research.
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to fly out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.
DARCY: Jane?
I think you want to see this.
JAN E: What is that?
ERIK: I thought you said it was a subtle aurora!
Go!
- Get closer. - Right. Good one.
Go!
(LAUGHING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
What are you doing?
I am not dying for six college credits!
(DARCY EXCLAIMING)
(THUNDER CRASHING)
(DARCY AND JANE EXCLAIMING)
(GASPS)
DARCY: I think that was legally your fault.
JANE: Get the first aid Kit.
Do me a favor and don't be dead.
Please.
Where did he come from?
ODIN: Once,
mankind accepted a simple truth,
that they were not alone in this universe.
Some worlds man believed to be home to their gods.
Others, they knew to fear.
From a realm of cold and darkness came the Frost Giants,
(SCREAMS)
threatening to plunge the mortal world into a new ice age.
(ROARS)
But humanity would not face this threat alone.
(YELLING)
Our armies drove the Frost Giants back into the heart of their own world.
The cost was great.
In the end,
their king fell.
And the source of their power was taken from them.
With the last great war ended,
we withdrew from the other worlds and returned home
to the Realm Eternal,
Asgard
Here we remain as a beacon of hope,
shining out across the stars.
And though we have fallen into man's myths and legends,
it was Asgard
and its warriors
that brought peace
to the universe.
But the day will come
when one of you
will have to defend that peace.
Do the Frost Giants still live?
When I'm king,
I'll hunt the monsters down and slay them all!
Just as you did, Father.
A wise king
never seeks out war.
But he must always be ready for it.
- I'm ready, Father. - So am I.
Only one of you can ascend to the throne.
But both of you were born to be kings.
(ALL CHEERING)
Oh, please.
(SPEAR THUDDING)
Thor Odinson,
my heir,
my firstborn.
So long entrusted with the mighty hammer Mjolnir,
forged in the heart of a dying star,
its power has no equal,
as a weapon to destroy
or as a tool to build.
'Tis a fit companion for a king.
I have defended Asgard
and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms
from the time of the great beginning.
Though the day has come...
Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?
I swear.
And do you swear to preserve the peace?
I swear.
Do you swear
to cast aside all selfish ambition
and to pledge yourself only to the good of the Realms?
I swear!
Then, on this day,
I, Odin Allfather,
proclaim you...
The Frost Giants!
(SPEAR THUDDING)
THOR: The Jotuns must pay for what they've done!
They have paid, with their lives.
The Destroyer did its work,
the Casket is safe, and all is well.
All is Well?
They broke into the weapons vault!
If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these relics...
- They didn't. - Well, I want to know why!
I have a truce with Laufey, King of the Jotuns.
He just broke your truce! They know you are vulnerable!
What action would you take?
March into Jotunheim as you once did. Teach them a lesson.
Break their spirits
so they'll never dare try to cross our borders again.
You're thinking only as a warrior.
This was an act of war!
It was the act of but a few, doomed to fail.
Look how far they got!
We will find the breach in our defenses and it will be sealed.
As King of Asgard....
But you're not king!
Not yer.
(ROARING)
It's unwise to be in my company right now, Brother.
This was to be my day of triumph.
It'll come.
In time.
What's this?
If it's any consolation, I think you're right.
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey, about everything.
If they found a way to penetrate Asgard's defenses once,
who's to say they won't try again?
- Next time with an army. - Exactly.
There's nothing you can do without defying Father.
No, no, no. I know that look.
That's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders.
Thor, it's madness.
Madness? What sort of madness?
We're going to Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG: What?
This isn't like a journey to Earth
where you summon a little lightning and thunder,
and the mortals worship you as a god.
This is Jotunheim.
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,
defeated their armies and took their Casket.
We would just be looking for answers.
It is forbidden!
(CHUCKLES)
My friends, have you forgotten all that we have done together?
Fandral, Hogun.
Who led you into the most glorious of battles?
You did.
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,
you thought you'd died and gone to Valhalla?
(LAUGHS)
You did.
Yes!
And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea
that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors
this realm has ever known?
I did.
True, but I supported you, Sif.
My friends,
we're going to Jotunheim.
You leave this to me.
- Good Heimdall... - You're not dressed warmly enough.
L.m S O Fry?
Do you think that you can deceive me?
-(LAUGHS) You must be mistaken... - THOR: Enough!
Heimdall, may we pass?
Never has an enemy slipped my watch until this day.
I wish to know how that happened.
Then tell no one where we have gone until we've returned.
Understand?
What happened? Silver tongue turn to lead?
(ALL LAUGHING)
HEIMDALL: Be warned.
I will honor my sworn oath to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.
If your return threatens the safety of Asgard,
Bifrost will remain closed to you
and you'll be left to die in the cold waste of Jotunheim.
VOLSTAGG: Couldn't you just leave the bridge open for us?
HEIMDALL: To leave the bridge open
would unleash the full power of the Bifrost
and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it.
I have no plans to die today.
None do.
We shouldn't be here.
Let's move.
Where are they?
Hiding,
as cowards always do.
LAUFEY: You've come a long way to die, Asgardians.
I am Thor Odinson!
LAUFEY: We know who you are.
How did your people get into Asgarol?
(EXHALES SLOWLY)
The House of Odin is full of traitors.
Do not dishonor my father's name with your lies!
Your father is a murderer and a thief!
And why have you come here? To make peace?
You long for battle. You crave it.
You're nothing but a boy
trying to prove himself a man.
THOR: Well, this "boy" has grown tired of your mockery.
Thor, stop and think.
Look around you, we're outnumbered.
Know your place, Brother.
You know not what your actions would unleash.
I do.
Go now, while I still allow it.
We will accept your most gracious offer.
(GRUNTS)
Come on, Brother.
FROST GIANT: Run back home, little princess.
Damn.
Next?
(LAUGHING)
(YELLING)
At least make it a challenge for me!
(ROARING)
That's more like it.
(GROANS)
Don't let them touch you!
(SCREAMS)
Thor!
- We must go! - Then go!
Run!
Thor!
(ROARS)
(LAUGHING)
Heimdall!
Open the bridge!
(ROARING)
(HORSE WHINNYING)
Father! We'll finish them together!
Silence!
Allfather.
You look weary.
Laufey,
end this now.
Your boy sought this out.
You're right.
And these are the actions of a boy, treat them as such.
You and I can end this here and now, before there's further bloodshed.
We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.
He'll get what he came for.
War
and death.
So be it.
THOR: Why did you bring us back?
ODIN: Do you realize what you've done?
- What you've started? - THOR: I was protecting my home.
You cannot even protect your friends!
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?
Get him to the healing room! Now!
THOR: There won't be a kingdom to protect if you're afraid to act.
The Jotuns must learn to fear me, just as they once feared you.
ODIN: That's pride and vanity talking, not leadership.
You've forgotten everything I taught you about a warrior's patience.
While you wait and be patient, the Nine Realms laugh at us.
The old ways are done.
You'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls.
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!
And you are an old man and a fool!
Yes.
I was a fool
to think you were ready.
- Father... -(ODIN SHOUTS)
Thor Odinson,
you have betrayed the express command of your king.
Through your arrogance and stupidity,
you've opened these peaceful realms and innocent lives
to the horror and desolation of war!
You are unworthy of these realms!
You're unworthy of your title!
You're unworthy
of the loved ones you have betrayed.
I now take from you your power!
In the name of my father
and his father before,
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy,
shall possess the power of Thor.
(DARCY AND JANE SCREAMING)
DARCY: I think that was legally your fault.
JANE: Get the first aid Kit.
Do me a favor and don't be dead.
(GASPS)
Whoa. Does he need CPR? Because I totally know CPR.
(GROANS)
Where did he come from?
You all right?
Hammer?
Hammer?
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. It's pretty obvious.
(GASPS) Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!
We have to move quickly before this all changes.
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.
- Father! - JANE: He's fine, look at him.
Heimdall! I know you can hear me! Open the Bifrost!
JANE: Hospital. You go, I'll stay.
You. What realm is this?
Alfheim? Nornheim?
New Mexico?
You dare threaten me, Thor, with so puny a weapon?
(FIRES TASER GUN)
(SHUDDERING)
What? He was freaking me out!
Next time you decide to taser somebody,
make sure he's already in the car, okay?
Jane! Come on.
NURSE: Name?
He said it was Thor?
T-H-O-R.
- And your relationship to him? - I've never met him before.
Until she hit him with a car.
I grazed him, but she tasered him.
Yes, I did.
Hi.
Just taking a little blood.
How dare you attack the son of Odin?
MALE NURSE: I need some help!
Call security!
MAN: Security to ER 3, stat!
You're no match for the Mighty...
Huh.
ERIK: You don't think this was just a magnetic storm, do you?
Look, the lensing around these edges
is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.
A what?
- I thought you were a science major? - Political science.
She was the only applicant.
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a theoretical connection
between two different points of space-time.
It's a wormhole.
- Erik, look. What do you see? - Stars.
Yeah, but not our stars.
See, this is the star alignment for our quadrant this time of year,
and unless Ursa Minor decided to take a day off,
these are someone else's constellations.
Hey! Check this out.
No, it can't be.
I think I left something at the hospital.
It's not possible!
(PANTING)
He was on drugs or something. He just went nuts.
DARCY: Oh, my God.
I just lost my most important piece of evidence.
Typical.
- So now what? - We find him.
Did you see what he did in there?
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.
Well, our data can't tell us what it was like to be inside that event,
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.
DARCY: Okay.
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico, right?
Exactly.
JAN E: What?
I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)
I got it, I got it.
MAN: Come on, kick it in now!
(ENGINE REWING)
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Did it Work?
(LAUGHING)
Sir, we found it.
You know, for a crazy homeless person, he's pretty cut.
Hey, sorry I tased you!
Excuse me, excuse me!
What is this?
Oh.
My ex.
Good with patients and bad with relationships.
They're the only clothes I had that would fit you.
They will suffice.
You're welcome.
THOR: This mortal form has grown weak.
I need sustenance.
We should never have let him go.
There was no stopping him.
FANDRAL: Well, at least he's only banished, not dead.
Which is what we'd all be
if that guard hadn't told Odin where we'd gone.
How did the guard even know?
I told him.
What?
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.
He should be flogged for taking so long.
We should never have reached Jotunheim.
You told the guard?
I saved our lives.
And Thor's.
I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
Loki.
You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind.
And if I do, then what?
I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is.
He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous.
You saw how he was today.
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?
He may speak of the good of Asgard, but he's always been jealous of Thor.
We should be grateful to him, he saved our lives.
Laufey said
there were traitors in the House of Odin.
A master of magic could bring three Jotuns into Asgard.
FANDRAL: Loki's always been one for mischief,
but you're talking about something else entirely.
ODIN: Stop!
LOKI: Am I cursed?
ODIN: No.
What am I?
You're my son.
What more than that?
The Casket wasn't the only thing you took from Jotunheim that day,
was it?
No.
In the aftermath of the battle,
I went into the temple and I found a baby.
(CRYING)
Small for a giant's offspring.
Abandoned, suffering, left to die.
Laufey's son.
Laufey's son.
Yes.
Why?
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood, why would you take me?
You were an innocent child.
No. You took me for a purpose. What was it?
(SHOUTING) Tell me!
I thought we could unite our kingdoms one day.
Bring about an alliance, bring about permanent peace.
Through you.
What?
But those plans no longer matter.
So I am no more than another stolen relic,
locked up here until you might have use of me.
Why do you twist my words?
You could have told me what I was from the beginning,
why didn't you?
You're my son.
I wanted only to protect you from the truth.
Because I'm the monster
parents tell their children about at night?
- No, no. - You know, it all makes sense now!
Why you favored Thor all these years!
Because no matter how much you claim to love me,
you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the throne of Asgard!
Guards!
Guards, please, help!
JANE: How'd you get inside that cloud?
DARCY: Also, how could you eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts
and still be this hungry?
- This drink, I like it. - I know. It's great, right?
Another!
JANE: Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.
- What was that? - It was delicious. I want another.
- Well, you could have just said so. - I just did.
- No, I mean, ask nicely. - I meant no disrespect.
All right. Well, no more smashing.
Deal?
You have my word.
Good.
MAN 1: The usual, please, Izzy.
MAN 2: You missed all the excitement out at the crater.
MAN 1: They're saying some kind of satellite landed out in the desert.
MAN 2: Yeah, we were having a good time with it
until the Feds showed up.
JANE: Excuse me. Did you say there was a satellite crash?
MAN 2: Yeah.
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook. Smile.
What did it look like, the satellite?
I don't know anything about satellites, but it was heavy.
I mean, nobody could lift it.
They said it was radioactive. I had my hands all over it.
Which way?
Fifty miles west of here.
MAN 1: Well, I wouldn't waste my time!
Looked like the whole Army was coming when we left.
-(BRAKES SQUEALING) -(HONKING)
DRIVER: Dumbass!
Where are you going?
- Fifty miles west of here. - Why?
- To get what belongs to me. - Oh, so you own a satellite now?
It's not what they say it is.
Well, whatever it is,
the government seems to think it's theirs.
So, you just intend to go in there and take it?
Yes.
If you take me there now,
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.
- Everything? - Yes.
All the answers you seek will be yours once I reclaim Mjolnir.
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?
Can I have a word, Jane?
Please don't do this.
(SOFTLY) You saw what I saw last night.
This is no coincidence. We have to find out what's in that crater.
But I'm not talking about the crater, I'm talking about him.
- But he's promising us the answers. - He's delusional.
Listen to what he's saying.
He's talking about Mjolnir and Thor and Bifrost.
It's the stories I grew up with as a child.
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.
He's dangerous, Jane.
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.
Then this is where we say goodbye.
(GIGGLES)
Um...
Thank you?
Jane Foster,
Erik Selvig,
Darcy,
farewell.
All right.
Back to work.
(TRUCK HONKING)
Hey!
That's my stuff!
What the hell is going on here?
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
Is that supposed to mean something to me?
- You can't do this! - Jane!
Jane, this is a lot more serious than you realize. Let it go.
Let it go? This is my life.
We're investigating a security threat.
We need to appropriate your records and all your atmospheric data.
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?
Here, this should more than compensate you
for your trouble.
I can't just buy replacements at Radio Shack,
I made most of this equipment myself!
Then I'm sure you can do it again.
And I'm sure I can sue you for violating my constitutional rights!
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster, but we're the good guys.
So are we!
I'm on the verge of understanding something extraordinary.
And everything I know about this phenomenon
is either in this lab or in this book.
And you can't just take this away... Hey!
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...
Thank you for your cooperation.
Years of research,
gone.
DARCY: They even took my iPod.
ERIK: What about the backups? JANE: They took our backups.
They took the backups of our backups. They were extremely thorough.
I just downloaded, like, 30 songs onto there.
Could you please stop with your iPod?
Who are these people?
I knew this scientist.
The pioneer in gamma radiation.
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up
and he wasn't heard from again.
They're not gonna do that to us. I'm gonna get everything back.
Come on, please. Let me contact one of my colleagues.
He's had some dealings with these people before.
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.
They took your laptop, too.
Allfather, we must speak with you urgently.
My friends.
Where's Odin?
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.
Mother fears he may never awaken again.
We would speak with her.
She has refused to leave my father's bedside.
You can bring your urgent matter to me.
(SPEAR THUDDING)
Your king.
My King, we would ask that you end Thor's banishment.
(CHUCKLES)
My first command cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.
Our people need a sense of continuity,
in order to feel safe in these difficult times.
All of us must stand together
for the good of Asgard.
Yes, of course.
- Good. Then you will wait for my word. - If I may
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty to perhaps reconsider...
We're done!
(scoffs)
I need a horse!
We don't have horses. Just dogs, cats, birds...
Then give me one of those large enough to ride.
-(HONKING) - Hey, you still need a lift?
I've never done anything like this before.
Have you ever done anything like this before?
Many times.
But you're brave to do it.
Well, they just stole my entire life's work.
I don't really have much left to lose.
Yeah, but you're clever.
Far more clever than anyone else in this realm.
"Realm"? "Realm"?
- You think me strange. - Yeah, I do.
Good strange or bad strange?
I'm not quite sure yet.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
(BOTH LAUGHING)
I'm sorry.
But who are you?
Really?
You'll see soon enough.
You promised me answers.
What you seek, it's a bridge.
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?
More like a Rainbow Bridge.
God, I hope you're not crazy.
LOKI: (SOFTLY) I never get used to seeing him like this.
FRIGGA: He's put it off for so long now, that I fear...
How long will it last?
I don't know. This time it's different. We were unprepared.
So why did he lie?
He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different.
You are our son, Loki,
and we, your family.
We mustn't lose hope that your father will return to us.
And your brother.
What hope is there for Thor?
There's always a purpose to everything your father does.
(THUNDER CRASHING)
JAN E: That's no satellite crash!
They would have hauled the wreckage away,
they wouldn't have built a city around it.
- You're going to need this. - What? Wait, why?
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
Now stay here.
Once I have Mjolnir, I will return the items they've stolen from you.
Deal?
No. Look what's down there.
You think you're just gonna walk in, grab our stuff and walk out?
No. I'm going to fly out.
TECHNICIAN: Sir, feed from the keyhole can barely penetrate the cloud cover.
Tech's barely working as it is,
with all the interference that thing's giving off.
And we've got a commercial aircraft coming right over us.
Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.
Reroute it like all the others.
Hold a sec.
We've got something outside the fence, west side.
AGENT: Delancey, Jackson. West side perimeter Go check it out.
There it is.
Delancey, Jackson. Report.
Agent down. We've got a perimeter breach.
(KLAXONS BLARING)
(GASPS)
You've reached Dr Erik Selvig. Please leave me a message.
Hi, Erik, it's me. Don't worry, I'm fine,
but just in case you don't hear from me in the next hour,
just come by the crater site and try and find me, okay?
I did exactly what you told me not to. I'm sorry.
So sorry. Bye.
AGENT 1: Bravo quadrant, move!
(THUNDER CRASHING)
(HIGH-PITCHED HUM)
AGENT 2: Entering south tunnel!
AGENT 3: Negative, negative. I have no comms.
AGENT 4: Target sighted, east tunnel!
I need eyes up high, with a gun.
Moving north!
What have we got?
There's a massive electromagnetic surge
coming off that thing.
Systems are barely coping.
Barton? Talk to me.
You want me to slow him down, sir?
Or are you sending in more guys for him to beat up?
I'll let you know.
You're big.
Fought bigger.
Better call it, Coulson, 'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.
Last chance, sir.
COULSON: Wait. I want to see this.
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
All right, show's over. Ground units, move in.
ERIK: He committed a crime. He's in jail!
JANE: I can't just leave him there! ERIK: Why?
You didn't see what I saw!
DARCY: (GASPS) Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.
Where'd you find this?
ERIK: The children's section.
I just wanted to show you how silly his story was.
But you're the one who's always pushing me
to chase down every possibility, every alternative!
I'm talking about science, not magic!
Well, magic's just science that we don't understand yet.
- Arthur C. Clarke. - Who wrote science fiction.
- A precursor to science fact! - In some cases, yeah.
Well, if there is an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,
then there's something on the other side.
And advanced beings could have crossed it!
Jane.
A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities.
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.
(SIGHS)
COULSON: You made my men,
some of the most highly trained professionals in the world,
look like a bunch of minimum-wage mall cops.
that's hurtful.
In my experience, it takes someone who's received similar training
to do what you did to them.
Why don't you tell me where you received your training?
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?
No, you strike me more as the soldier of fortune type.
Where was it? South Africa?
Certain groups pay very well for a good mercenary like you.
Who are you?
One way or another, we find out what we need to know.
We're good at that.
(PAGER BEEPING)
Don't go anywhere.
Loki! What are you doing here?
I had to see you.
What's happened?
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?
Let me explain to Father.
Father is dead.
What?
Your banishment,
the threat of a new war,
it was too much for him to bear.
You mustn't blame yourself.
I know that you loved him.
I tried to tell him so, but he wouldn't listen.
It was so cruel to put the hammer within your reach,
knowing that you could never lift it.
The burden of the throne has fallen to me now.
Can I come home?
The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way... - And Mother has forbidden your return.
This is goodbye, Brother.
I'm so sorry.
No.
I am sorry.
Thank you for coming here.
Farewell.
Goodbye.
Good bye?
I just got back.
(STATIC CRACKLING)
(MJOLNIR HUMMING)
Sir?
He's got a visitor.
His name is Donald Blake?
Dr. Donald Blake.
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.
He was distraught when he found out that you've taken all our research.
That was years of his life, gone!
You can understand how a man could go off like that.
A big, faceless organization like yours
coming in with their jackbooted thugs and...
That's how he put it.
That still doesn't explain
how he managed to tear through our security.
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.
(ALARM BEEPS)
TECHNICIAN: Sir?
It says here that he's an M.D.
Well, he is! Or he was.
He switched careers and became a physicist.
A brilliant physicist.
He's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.
ERIK: Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!
There you are. You're gonna be all right. I'm taking you home now.
COULSON: Dr. Selvig!
Just keep him away from the bars.
I will!
- Where are we going? - To get a drink.
Follow them.
You know, I had it all backwards.
I had it all wrong.
It's not a bad thing finding out that you don't have all the answers.
You start asking the right questions.
For the first time in my life,
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.
Anyone who's ever going to find his way in this world
has to start by admitting he doesn't know where the hell he is.
Thank you for what you've done.
No, don't thank me. I only did it for Jane.
Her father and I taught at university together.
He was a good man.
He never listened.
Neither did I.
My father was trying to teach me something,
but I was too stupid to see it.
I don't know if you're delusional or if you're pulling some kind of con,
I don't care.
I just care about her.
I've seen the way she looks at you.
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.
Good.
In that case, I'll buy you another round, and you leave town tonight.
Two boilermakers.
LAUFEY: Kill him.
After all I've done for you?
So you're the one who showed us the way into Asgard.
That was just a bit of fun, really.
To ruin my brother's big day.
And to protect the realm from his idiotic rule for a while longer.
I will hear you.
I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers,
lead you into Odin's chambers, and you can slay him where he lies.
Why not kill him yourself?
(SNORTS)
I suspect that the Asgardians would not take kindly
to a king who had murdered his predecessor.
Once Odin is dead, I will return the Casket to you
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...
Glory.

Accept.
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim, but could neither see you nor hear you.
You were shrouded from me,
like the Frost Giants that entered this realm.
Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
Or perhaps someone has found a way
to hide that which he does not wish me to see.
You have great power, Heimdall.
Did Odin ever fear you?
- No. - And why is that?
Because he is my king and I am sworn to obey him.
He was your king and you're sworn to obey me now.
Yes?
Yes.
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one
until I have repaired the damage that my brother has done.
(BANGING ON DOOR)
(GASPS) Oh, my God. Is he okay?
He's fine. Not injured at all.
-(GROANS) - I'm sorry, my friend.
- What happened? - We drank, we fought,
he made his ancestors proud.
Put him on the bed.
(GROANS)
(LAUGHING)
I still don't think you're the God of Thunder.
But you ought to be.
Are these your chambers?
It's more of a temporary living situation.
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.
Actually, I never have guests.
That's not the right place for it.
I'm sorry.
Can we go outside?
Yes, of course.
I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data, or when Darcy's driving me crazy.
I come up here a lot, actually, now that I think about it.
I'm really glad you're safe.
You've been very kind to me,
and I've been far less grateful than you deserve.
Well, I hit you with my car a couple times,
so I think that kind of evens things out.
Perhaps I had it coming.
Oh, my God!
I don't believe it!
It was all I could get back. I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.
No, no, this is great! This is... I don't have to start from scratch now.
Thank you.
What's wrong?
S.H.l.E.L.D.
Whatever they are,
they're gonna do everything in their power
to make sure this research never sees the light of day.
No, Jane.
Listen to me. You must not give up.
- You must finish what you've started. - Why?
Because you're right.
Here, look.
Your ancestors called it magic, and you call it science.
Well, I come from a place where they're one and the same thing.
What is that?
My father explained it to me like this,
that your world
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,
linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil,
the Worlds Tree.
Now you see it every day without realizing.
The images glimpsed through... What did you call it?
This Hooble Telescope.
- Hubble. - Hubble Telescope.
(LAUGHS)
Tell me more.
So, the Nine Realms.
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.
This is Alfheim.
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.
And Asgard.
And that's where I come from.
Thank you, Jane.
FANDRAL: Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne,
Asgard on the brink of war, yet you've managed to consume
four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef,
and two casks of ale. Shame on you. Don't you care?
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!
Stop it, both of you!
Stop.
- We all know what we have to do. - We must go.
We must find Thor.
It's treason.
To hell with treason, it's suicide.
Thor would do the same for us.
Now shush.
Heimdall might be watching.
(DOORS OPENING)
Heimdall demands your presence.
VOLSTAGG: We're doomed.
You would defy the commands of Loki, our king,
break every oath you have taken as warriors,
and commit treason to bring Thor back?
- Yes. - Good.
So you'll help us?
I am bound by honor to our king. I cannot open the bridge to you.
Complicated fellow, isn't he?
Now what do we do?
Look!
- What the hell was that? - I don't know, sir.
We got massive energy readings out of nowhere
and then they just disappeared. Fifteen miles due northwest.
Let's go take a look.
Thank you.
- Thank you. - You're very welcome.
AGENT: Base to Team 2, we've got activity outside the town.
Stay on your target.
(SPEAR THUDDING)
Ensure my brother does not return.
Destroy everything.
Mom?
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?
Call it in.
Yeah.
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan and Robin Hood.
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.
But you won't be able to convince the scientific community of any of it.
Not without hard evidence.
Found you!
THOR: My friends!
This is good! This is good.
I don't believe it.
Oh, excuse me. Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.
My friends,
I've never been happier to see anyone.
But you should not have come.
We're here to take you home.
You know I can't go home.
My father
is dead because of me.
And I must remain in exile.
Thor,
your father still lives.
Tell me, Loki, how did you get the Jotuns into Asgarol?
You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of this realm?
There are secret paths between the worlds
to which even you, with all your gifts, are blind.
But I have need of them no longer, now that I am king.
And I say, for your act of treason,
you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper,
and no longer citizen of Asgard.
Then I need no longer obey you.
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.
(THUNDER CRASHING)
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
Was somebody else coming?
Is that one of StarK's?
I don't know. The guy never tells me anything.
Hello.
You are using unregistered weapons technology.
Identify yourself
Here we go.
Incoming!
Jane, you have to leave.
- What are you gonna do? - I'm staying here.
Thor's going to fight with us!
My friends,
I'm just a man. I'll only be in the way, or worse, get one of you killed.
But I can help get these people to safety.
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.
- We'll need some time. - You'll have it!
Okay, move it, people!
Everybody out! Use the back door.
Go, hurry! You can eat later.
Keep it distracted.
For Asgard!
SIF: Fall back!
Go. Now. Run!
(SCREAMING)
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.
No. I will die a warrior's death.
Stories will be told of this day.
Live, and tell those stories yourself.
Now go.
You must return to Asgard. You have to stop Loki.
What about you?
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.
Come on.
We need to fall back. Come on.
Come on.
Wait!
What's he doing?
Brother, whatever I have done to wrong you,
whatever I have done to lead you to do this,
I am truly sorry.
But these people are innocent.
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.
So take mine
and end this.
No.
(GASPS)
It's over.
No. it's not over.
I mean, you're safe.
We're safe.
It's over.
(THOR INHALING DEEPLY)
No.
No.
AGENT 1: We're spiking. AGENT 2: Levels increase!
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,
shall possess the power of Thor.
(MJOLNIR WHOOSHING)
Jane!
- No. No. No! - Come!
Oh. My. God.
So, is this how you normally look?
More or less.
It's a good look.
We must go to the Bifrost site. I would have words with my brother.
COULSON: Excuse me!
Donald?
I don't think you've been completely honest with me.
Know this, Son of Coul.
You and I, we fight for the same cause, the protection of this world.
From this day forward, you can count me as your ally
if you return the items you have taken from Jane.
- Stolen. - Borrowed.
Of course, you can have your equipment back.
You're gonna need it to continue your research.
Would you like to see the bridge we spoke of?
Sure.
(EXCLAIMS)
COULSON: Wait, I need to debrief you!
Welcome to Asgard.
(MUFFLED STRAINING)
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.
Heimdall?
Heimdall!
He doesn't answer.
Then we are stranded.
Heimdall! If you can hear me, we need you now!
(MUFFLED ROARING)
Heimdall! We need you now!
Heimdall!
I must go back to Asgard, but I give you my word,
I will return for you.
Deal?
Deal.
Get him to the healing room!
Leave my brother to me.
LAUFEY: It's Said
you can still hear and see what transpires around you.
I hope it's true,
so that you may know
your death came at the hand
of Laufey.
And your death came by the son of Odin.
(GASPING)
Loki!
You saved him!
I swear to you, Mother,
that they will pay for what they've done today.
THOR: Loki.
Thor!
I knew you'd return to us.
Why don't you tell her
how you sent the Destroyer to kill our friends, to kill me?
What?
Why, it must have been enforcing Father's last command.
You're a talented liar, Brother. Always have been.
It's good to have you back.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to destroy Jotunheim.
LOKI: You can't stop it.
The Bifrost will build until it rips Jotunheim apart.
(FROST GIANTS SCREAMING)
Jane?
Why have you done this?
To prove to Father that I am the worthy son.
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.
I will have destroyed that race of monsters.
And I will be true heir to the throne!
You can't kill an entire race!
Why not?
And what is this newfound love for the Frost Giants?
You could have killed them all with your bare hands.
- I've changed. - So have I.
Now fight me.
I never wanted the throne!
I only ever wanted to be your equal.
I will not fight you, Brother!
I'm not your brother.
I never was.
Loki, this is madness.
Is it madness?
Is it?
Is it?
Come on. What happened to you on Earth that turned you so soft?
Don't tell me it was that woman.
Oh!
It was!
Well, maybe, when we're finished here, I'll pay her a visit myself!
(YELLING)
(LAUGHING)
Thor!
Brother, please.
(LAUGHING)
Enough!
(GRUNTING)
(SCREAMING)
Look at you,
the Mighty Thor,
with all your strength,
and what good does it do you now, huh?
Do you hear me, Brother? There's nothing you can do!
What are you doing?
If you destroy the bridge, you'll never see her again!
Forgive me, Jane.
(BOTH YELLING)
I could have done it, Father!
I could have done it!
For you!
For all of us!
NO, Loki.
Loki, no.
No!
No.
JANE: it's gone.
(ALL LAUGHING)
And then, with a mighty bellow,
I flew into the giant metal creature and laid him low!
FANDRAL: Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge ass?
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact, falling was a tactic lulling the Destroyer...
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.
FRIGGA: How is he?
SIF: He mourns for his brother.
And...
He misses hen
The mortal.
You'll be a wise king.
There will never be a wiser king than you.
Or a better father.
I have much to learn.
I know that now.
Someday, perhaps,
I shall make you proud.
You've already made me proud.
So Earth is lost to us.
No.
There is always hope.
Can you see her?
(HEIMDALL LAUGHS)
Yes.
ERIK: I have the particle detectors!
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D. satellite codes?
DARCY: Yeah. Have you seen my taser?
THOR: How is she?
ERIK: In the car. Come on, Jane!
HEIMDALL: She searches for you.
NICK FURY: Dr. Selvig.
So you're the man behind all this?
It's quite a labyrinth.
I was thinking they're taking me down here to kill me.
I've been hearing about the New Mexico situation.
Your work has impressed a lot of people who are much smarter than I am.
I have a lot to work with.
The Foster Theory. A gateway to another dimension.
It's unprecedented.
Isn't it?
Legend tells us one thing, history, another.
But every now and then, we find something that belongs to both.
What is it?
Power, Doctor.
If we can figure out how to tap it,
maybe unlimited power.
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
